   <p>The Materials and Methods section should provide enough detail to allow suitably skilled investigators to fully replicate your study. Specific information and/or protocols for new methods should be included in detail. If materials, methods, and protocols are well established, authors may cite articles where those protocols are described in detail, but the submission should include sufficient information to be understood independent of these references.</p> 
   <p>We encourage authors to submit detailed protocols for newer or less well-established methods as supporting information. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information">Read the supporting information guidelines.</a></p> 
   <h4>Human or animal subjects and/or tissue or field sampling</h4> 
   <p>Methods sections describing research using human or animal subjects and/or tissue or field sampling must include required ethics statements. <a data-parent-id="34" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-guidelines-for-specific-study-types">See the reporting guidelines for human research, clinical trials, animal research, and observational and field studies for more information</a>.</p> 
   <h4>Data</h4> 
   <p>PLOS journals require authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception.</p> 
   <p>Large data sets, including raw data, may be deposited in an appropriate public repository.&nbsp;<a data-parent-id="36" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-recommended-repositories">See our list of recommended repositories.</a></p> 
   <p>For smaller data sets and certain data types, authors may provide their data within&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/supporting-information">supporting information files</a>&nbsp;accompanying the manuscript. Authors should take care to maximize the accessibility and reusability of the data by selecting a file format from which data can be efficiently extracted (for example, spreadsheets or flat files should be provided rather than PDFs when providing tabulated data).<br> For more information on how best to provide data, read our<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/s/data-availability">&nbsp;</a><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability">policy on data availability</a>. PLOS does not accept references to “data not shown.”</p> 
   <h4>Cell lines</h4> 
   <p>Methods sections describing research using cell lines must state the origin of the cell lines used. <a data-parent-id="34" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-cell-lines">See the reporting guidelines for cell line research for more information</a>.</p>

These sections may be further divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading, as appropriate. These sections have no word limit, but the language should be clear and concise.</p> 
   <p>Together, these sections should describe the results of the experiments, the interpretation of these results, and the conclusions that can be drawn.</p> 
   <p>Authors should explain how the results relate to the hypothesis presented as the basis of the study and provide a succinct explanation of the implications of the findings, particularly in relation to previous related studies and potential future directions for research.</p> 
   <p><i>PLOS ONE</i> editorial decisions do not rely on perceived significance or impact, so authors should avoid overstating their conclusions. See the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/criteria-for-publication"><i>PLOS ONE</i> Criteria for Publication</a> for more information.</p>

    <br> Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use language-editing and copyediting services. Obtaining this service is the responsibility of the author, and should be done before initial submission. These services can be found on the web using search terms like “scientific editing service”&nbsp;or “manuscript editing service.”

   <p>Authors can submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All supporting information will be subject to peer review. All file types can be submitted, but files must be smaller than 10 MB in size.</p> 
   <p>Authors may use almost any description as the item name for a supporting information file as long as it contains an “S”&nbsp;and number. For example, “S1 Appendix” and “S2 Appendix,”&nbsp;“S1 Table” and “S2 Table,”&nbsp;and so forth. &nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Supporting information files are published exactly as provided, and are not copyedited.</p> 
   <h4>Supporting information captions</h4> 
   <p>List supporting information captions at the end of the manuscript file. Do not submit captions in a separate file.</p> 
   <p>The file number and name are required in a caption, and we highly recommend including a one-line title as well. You may also include a legend in your caption, but it is not required.</p>

   <p>Repositories may be either subject-specific (where these exist) and accept specific types of structured data, or generalist repositories that accept multiple data types. We recommend that authors select repositories appropriate to their field. Repositories may be subject-specific (e.g., GenBank for sequences and PDB for structures), general, or institutional, as long as DOIs or accession numbers are provided and the data are at least as open as CC BY. Authors are encouraged to select repositories that meet accepted criteria as trustworthy digital repositories, such as criteria of the Centre for Research Libraries or Data Seal of Approval.

   <p>For manuscripts disputing previously published work, it is&nbsp;<em>PLOS ONE</em>&nbsp;policy to invite input from the disputed author during the peer review process. This procedure is aimed at ensuring a thorough, transparent, and productive review process.</p>

    <li> <strong>The name of the approving institutional review board or equivalent committee(s)</strong>. If approval was not obtained, the authors must provide a detailed statement explaining why it was not needed</li> 
    <li> <strong>Whether informed consent was written or oral</strong>. If informed consent was oral, it must be stated in the manuscript: 
     <ul> 
      <li>Why written consent could not be obtained</li> 
      <li>That the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved use of oral consent</li> 
      <li>How oral consent was documented</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>For studies involving humans categorized by race/ethnicity, age, disease/disabilities, religion, sex/gender, sexual orientation, or other socially constructed groupings, authors should:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Explicitly describe their methods of categorizing human populations</li> 
    <li>Define categories in as much detail as the study protocol allows</li> 
    <li>Justify their choices of definitions and categories, including for example whether any rules of human categorization were required by their funding agency</li> 
    <li>Explain whether (and if so, how) they controlled for confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, nutrition, environmental exposures, or similar factors in their analysis</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>In addition, outmoded terms and potentially stigmatizing labels should be changed to more current, acceptable terminology. Examples: “Caucasian”&nbsp;should be changed to “white”&nbsp;or “of [Western] European descent”&nbsp;(as appropriate); “cancer victims”&nbsp;should be changed to “patients with cancer.”</p> 
   <p>For papers that include identifying, or potentially identifying, information, authors must download the&nbsp;<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/file?id=8ce6/plos-consent-form-english.pdf">Consent Form for Publication in a PLOS Journal&nbsp;(PDF)</a>, which the individual, parent, or guardian must sign once they have read the paper and been informed about the terms of PLOS open-access license. The signed consent form should not be submitted with the manuscript, but authors should securely file it in the individual's case notes and the methods section of the manuscript should explicitly state that consent authorization for publication is on file, using wording like:</p> 
   <p><strong>The individual in this manuscript has given written informed consent (as outlined in PLOS consent form) to publish these case details.</strong></p>

   <p><em>PLOS ONE</em>&nbsp;will consider submissions that present new methods, software, or databases as the primary focus of the manuscript if they meet the following criteria:</p> 
   <div class="block-basic"> 
    <br> 
    <strong>Utility</strong>
    <br> The tool must be of use to the community and must present a proven advantage over existing alternatives, where applicable. Recapitulation of existing methods, software, or databases is not useful and will not be considered for publication. Combining data and/or functionalities from other sources may be acceptable, but simpler instances (i.e. presenting a subset of an already existing database) may not be considered. For software, databases, and online tools, the long-term utility should also be discussed, as relevant. This discussion may include maintenance, the potential for future growth, and the stability of the hosting, as applicable.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <strong>Validation</strong>
    <br> Submissions presenting methods, software, databases, or tools must demonstrate that the new tool achieves its intended purpose. If similar options already exist, the submitted manuscript must demonstrate that the new tool is an improvement over existing options in some way. This requirement may be met by including a proof-of-principle experiment or analysis; if this is not possible, a discussion of the possible applications and some preliminary analysis may be sufficient.
    <br> 
    <br> 
    <strong>Availability</strong>
    <br> Software should be open source, deposited in an appropriate archive, and conform to the 
    <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source Definition</a>. Databases must be open-access and hosted somewhere publicly accessible, and any software used to generate a database should also be open source. If relevant, databases should be open for appropriate deposition of additional data. Dependency on commercial software such as Mathematica and MATLAB does not preclude a paper from consideration, although complete open source solutions are preferred. Authors should provide a direct link to the deposited software or the database hosting site from within the paper.
   </div> 
   <h4>Software submissions</h4> 
   <p>Manuscripts describing software should provide full details of the algorithms designed. Describe any dependencies on commercial products or operating system. Include details of the supplied test data and explain how to install and run the software. A brief description of enhancements made in the major releases of the software may also be given. Authors should provide a direct link to the deposited software from within the paper.</p> 
   <h4>Database submissions</h4> 
   <p>For descriptions of databases, provide details about how the data were curated, as well as plans for long-term database maintenance, growth, and stability. Authors should provide a direct link to the database hosting site from within the paper.</p>

   <h3> <a data-anchor-id="5355" id="loc-new-taxon-names" name="loc-new-taxon-names"></a>New taxon names</h3> 
   <h4>Zoological names</h4> 
   <p>When publishing papers that describe a new zoological taxon name, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the&nbsp;<a href="http://iczn.org/">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)</a>. Effective 1 January 2012, the ICZN considers an online-only publication to be legitimate if it meets the criteria of archiving and is registered in ZooBank, the ICZN's official registry.</p> 
   <p>For proper registration of a new zoological taxon, we require two specific statements to be included in your manuscript.</p> 
   <p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Results</strong>&nbsp;section, the globally unique identifier (GUID), currently in the form of a Life Science Identifier (LSID), should be listed under the new species name, for example:</p> 
   <div class="block-quote">
    <em><strong>Anochetus boltoni</strong>&nbsp;Fisher&nbsp;<strong>sp. nov.</strong>&nbsp;urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:B6C072CF-1CA6-40C7-8396-534E91EF7FBB</em>
   </div> 
   <p>You will need to contact&nbsp;<a href="http://zoobank.org/">Zoobank</a>&nbsp;to obtain a GUID (LSID). Please do this as early as possible to avoid delay of publication upon acceptance of your manuscript. It is your responsibility to provide us with this information so we can include it in the final published paper.</p> 
   <p>Please also insert the following text into the&nbsp;<strong>Methods</strong>&nbsp;section, in a sub-section to be called “Nomenclatural Acts”:</p> 
   <div class="block-basic">
    The electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the amended International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, and hence the new names contained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of this article. This published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the online registration system for the ICZN. The ZooBank LSIDs (Life Science Identifiers) can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the LSID to the prefix “http://zoobank.org/”. The LSID for this publication is: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub: XXXXXXX. The electronic edition of this work was published in a journal with an ISSN, and has been archived and is available from the following digital repositories: PubMed Central, LOCKSS [author to insert any additional repositories].
   </div> 
   <p>All PLOS articles are deposited in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed Central</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lockss.org/">LOCKSS</a>. If your institute, or those of your co-authors, has its own repository, we recommend that you also deposit the published online article there and include the name in your article.</p> 
   <h4>Botanical names</h4> 
   <p>When publishing papers that describe a new botanical taxon, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). The following guidelines for publication in an online-only journal have been agreed such that any scientific botanical name published by us is considered effectively published under the rules of the Code. Please note that these guidelines differ from those for zoological nomenclature, and apply only to seed plants, ferns, and lycophytes.</p> 
   <p>Effective January 2012, the description or diagnosis of a new taxon can be in either Latin or English. This does not affect the requirements for scientific names, which are still to be Latin.</p> 
   <p>Also effective January 2012, the electronic PDF represents a published work according to the ICN for algae, fungi, and plants.

   <p>For proper registration of the new taxon, we require two specific statements to be included in your manuscript.</p> 
   <p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Results</strong>&nbsp;section, the globally unique identifier (GUID), currently in the form of a Life Science Identifier (LSID), should be listed under the new species name, for example:</p> 
   <div class="block-quote">

   </div> 
   <p>Journal staff will contact IPNI to obtain the GUID (LSID) after your manuscript is accepted for publication, and this information will then be added to the manuscript during the production phase</p> 
   <p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Methods</strong>&nbsp;section, include a sub-section called “Nomenclature”&nbsp;using the following wording:</p> 
   <div class="block-basic">
    The electronic version of this article in Portable Document Format (PDF) in a work with an ISSN or ISBN will represent a published work according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and hence the new names contained in the electronic publication of a PLOS article are effectively published under that Code from the electronic edition alone, so there is no longer any need to provide printed copies.
    <br> 
    <br> In addition, new names contained in this work have been submitted to IPNI, from where they will be made available to the Global Names Index. The IPNI LSIDs can be resolved and the associated information viewed through any standard web browser by appending the LSID contained in this publication to the prefix http://ipni.org/. The online version of this work is archived and available from the following digital repositories: [INSERT NAMES OF DIGITAL REPOSITORIES WHERE ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT WILL BE SUBMITTED (PubMed Central, LOCKSS etc)].

   <h4>Fungal names</h4> 
   <p>When publishing papers that describe a new botanical taxon, PLOS aims to comply with the requirements of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). The following guidelines for publication in an online-only journal have been agreed such that any scientific botanical name published by us is considered effectively published under the rules of the Code. Please note that these guidelines differ from those for zoological nomenclature.</p>

   <p>You will need to contact either&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mycobank.org/">Mycobank</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indexfungorum.org/">Index Fungorum</a>&nbsp;to obtain the GUID (LSID). Please do this as early as possible to avoid delay of publication upon acceptance of your manuscript. It is your responsibility to provide us with this information so we can include it in the final published paper. Effective January 2013, all papers describing new fungal species must reference the identifier issued by a recognized repository in the protologue in order to be considered effectively published.</p> 
   <p>In the&nbsp;<strong>Methods</strong>&nbsp;section, include a sub-section called “Nomenclature”&nbsp;using the following wording (this example is for taxon names submitted to MycoBank; please substitute appropriately if you have submitted to Index Fungorum):</p>

   <p>Qualitative research studies use non-quantitative methods to address a defined research question that may not be accessible by quantitative methods, such as people's interpretations, experiences, and perspectives. The analysis methods are explicit, systematic, and reproducible, but the results do not involve numerical values or use statistics. Examples of qualitative data sources include, but are not limited to, interviews, text documents, audio/video recordings, and free-form answers to questionnaires and surveys.</p> 
   <p>Qualitative research studies should be reported in accordance to the&nbsp;<a href="http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/content/19/6/349.long">Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ)&nbsp;checklist</a>. Further reporting guidelines can be found in the Equator Network's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.equator-network.org/resource-centre/library-of-health-research-reporting/reporting-guidelines/qualitative-research/">Guidelines for reporting qualitative research</a>.</p>
