	the novelty of the material produced so far and, and as a result
	of this evaluation, it generates a set of guildelines that work as

  annote = {http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2009/2201 - Creativity and
	Uncertainty - The Creative Gap - Final Comment Summary -------------
	Focus is on uncertainty in creativity and the creative gap in computational
	creativity (and I assume in general creativity) between the creator's
	original intentions and any unpredictable results of their work (Asaf
	closely correlates uncertainty with unpredictability). Using mutlidisciplinary
	information to help model how we navigate this gap will help advance
	our computational theories of creativity. Creativity and Uncertainty
	---------------------------------- Uncertainty is "that unique condition
	of vagueness and unexpectedness [which] inevitably tags along any
	creative process." (p. 1-2) Asaf poses the question (p. 1) "what
	is uncertainty, if not a condition of unpredictability?" [I think
	they are two slightly separatable concepts - uncertainty is more
	directed towards whether or not a particular goal will be achieved,
	whereas unpredictability incorporates undirected exploration and
	discovery. However the point is only made by Asaf to justify the
	Maggie Boden quote "Unpredictability is often said to be the essence
	of creativity" from Boden 95 Creativity and Unpredictability (Stanford
	Humanities Review 3 (2) pp123-139 - and MB is one of the organisers
	at Dagstuhl] Links between uncertainty and creativity have been drawn
	by many - Asaf cites Paul Virilio's (2007, 2004) philosophical views
	fo the 'accident of art', Poincare's (1952) views on chance discovery,
	John Cage's 'Indeterminancy' (unreferenced) and surrealist artists
	such as Dada and Duchamp, for whom (p2): "creativity resided in the
	ability to 'unlock' the unconsciousness through various kinds of
	devies and representations" ... "influenced by Feud's psychoanalytical
	theory of insight, reflected upon the idea of the indriect knowledge
	that rises to the surface at a creative moment". In other words a
	lot of creative processing happens at a subconscious level and creativity
	is the ability to access this processing (or in any case, the results)
	at a conscious level. Intention ------s-u-b-c-o-n-s-c-i-o-u-s--p-r-o-c-e-s-s-i-n-g----->
	Realisation The Creative Gap ----------------------- The gap Asaf
	refers to is that between intention and realisation. Asaf's current
	research involves interviewing creative practioners in the field
	of art and design, to find out about their creative processes when
	they use computational methods. Common themes have arisen despite
	varying backgrounds of her participants: - computer enhances how
	they look at the information available, highlighting patterns and
	showing surprising results that may not have been noticed without
	the support of the computer tool. [Anything else?] Suggests a computer-enhanced
	creativity. Will be interesting to see what else results from her
	findings. Talks about emergence and feedback between computer and
	human - both computer and human are active partners in the feedback
	cycle and both make contributions towards realising the creative
	intentions. Final Comment --------------------- Multidisciplinary
	approach best to help fill in the gaps in creativity research. In
	particular, Asaf highlights as a key "missing link" (p. 4) what we
	understand about creative thought processes in both arts and sciences.

  title = {The Case for Domain Specificity of Creativity},
  journal = {Creativity Research Journal},
  year = {1998},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {173-177},
  number = {2},
  annote = {As part of a debate with Plucker \cite{plucker98} in the \emph{Creativity
	Research Journal}, Baer argues here that creativity is domain-specific;
	that is, that creativity in a particular domain is independent of
	creativity in another domain. Although Baer puts forward evidence
	for this claim, he concedes that there is not yet a definitive accepted
	right answer to the question: is creativity domain-specific or domain-general,
	but claims that domain specificity of creativity is the safer working
	assumption for researchers to make. 
	
	\begin{quote} `Despite their limited range, we may have to settle
	for many small theories rather than a single grand one. Such a fragmented
	approach is naturally less satisfying than the search for a unified
	and all-encompassing theory, but it fits the evidence better and
	will provide more useful direction to new theories and research.'
	\cite[p. 173]{baer98} \end{quote}
	
	Baer's arguments are two-fold: that 1. there is sufficient valid evidence
	for domain specificity of creativity, and 2. that the evidence for
	domain generality of creativity is weak or non-existent. 
	
	A point that Baer makes early on is that it is tricky to define what
	is meant by \emph{domain}; it depends on where the line is drawn
	for the boundary of a particular domain. For example, should the
	domain for the case studies in Chapter 6 be music systems, or improvisation
	systems, or music improvisation systems, or jazz music improvisation
	systems, or traditional jazz improvisation systems? All these labels
	describe the systems analysed in Chapter 6 to differing degrees of
	specificity. \citeA{baer98} concentrates on `broadly defined cognitive
	domains (e.g. linguistic, mathematical, musical)' as opposed to \emph{microdomains}:
	`task or content domains (e.g., poetry writing, story writing, collage
	making)'\cite[p. 174]{baer98}.
	
	Baer offers several examples where creativity in one domain does not
	necessarily correlate to creativity in another, as judged by domain
	experts in each domain \cite{amabile96}. Whether or not this relates
	to the level of domain knowledge expressed in each case, is left
	unsaid in Baer's summary.
	
	Evidence for domain generality in creative behaviour is criticised
	by Baer for largely relying on subjective self-reports by the study
	participants; Baer discusses how self-assessment evidence can be
	unreliable, both in creativity research and beyond. While discussing
	evidence for domain generality of creativity, Baer also criticises
	divergent thinking tests as a general test for creativity:
	
	\begin{quote} `One area of creativity theory and assessment has assumed
	and widely promoted the idea of generality in creative-thinking skills.
	Divergent thinking has dominated the field of creativity. ... The
	case against divergent thinking as an all-purpose creative-thinking
	skill has been made elsewhere ... Although divergent thinking appears
	to have failed both as a general theory and as a method for testing
	creativity, it is worth noting that divergent thinking can nonetheless
	be a significant contributor to creativity without being a general,
	domain-transcending thinking skill.' \cite[pp. 175-176]{baer98} \end{quote}
	
	Baer comments that it is safer for creativity researchers to assume
	that creativity is domain-specific rather than domain-general, even
	if they are not sure of this being the correct assumption to make.
	He illustrates this by thinking of creative development exercises:
	\begin{quote} `if the generic hypothesis is correct, then the content
	of the exercises one uses does not matter and nothing is lost by
	making the incorrect (domain specificity) assumption. But if the
	specificity hypothesis is correct and one chooses all exercises from
	the same domain (which the generic hypothesis allows), then the loss
	will be significant, as any improvement in creative thinking will
	be limited to the single content domain from which the exercises
	are chosen.' \cite[p. 176]{baer98} \end{quote}
	
	Baer concedes that there may be domain-general factors that influence
	creativity e.g. `motivational constraints'\cite[p. 176]{baer98},
	but he believes that (probably) no domain general `personality traits
	or cognitive mechanisms exist that influence creativity across domains'\cite[p.
	176]{baer98}.

	suggests that ``creative autonomy,'' which exists when a system not

	without explicit direction, is a necessary condition for making this
	argument. Rather than requiring that the system be hermetically sealed
	to avoid perceptions of human influence, developing creative autonomy
	is argued to be more plausible if the system is intimately embedded
	in a broader society of other creators and critics. Ideas are presented
	for constructing systems that might be able to achieve creative autonomy.},

	which H-creativity is a special case." also - evaluation by the programmer
	or the audience? as an interesting aside... Boden 1994 (p. 115):
	"only an expert in a given domain can write interesting programs
	modeling that domain."\cite[p. 115]{boden94a} Boden 1994 (p. 114):
	The common phenomenon of initial scorn followed by universal acceptance
	reflects the difficulty people sometimes have of relating a new idea
	to the underlying space that generated it. Boden 1994 (p. 113): "In
	general, one cannot assess creative ideas by a scalar metric. ...
	The appropriate method of assessment would have to take into account
	the fact that conceptual spaces are multidimensional structures,
	where some features are "deeper", more influential, than others.
	... To compare the degree of creativity of two ideas, we would have
	to weigh depth against number: novelty in one deepfeature (a core
	dimension of the space) might outweigh several simultaneous novelties
	in more superficial features." It's not always about transformational
	creativity - Boden points to Mozart vs Haydn as an example where
	exploratory creativity is more highly valued than transformational
	creativity [although what about the later, almost atonal Mozart work?]
	Boden 1994 (p. 114): "Comparative assessments of creativity must
	recognize that many creative achievements involve exploration, and
	perhaps tweaking, of a conceptual space, rather than radical transformation
	of it. The more complex the space, the greater its exploratory potential,
	the more "mere" exploration will be valued. (This is true only up
	to a point: if the space is so complex as to be unintelligibile to
	us, even in an intuitive way, its generative products will be rejected.

	``the superhuman human fallacy''[p. 24] - that most humans can't
	match GENIUS intelligence, so to fail at achieving this is not the
	end of the road for AI research, it just means that at this stage
	in research we should concentrate on EVERYDAY human intelligence
	rather than being overly concerned about replicating standards of
	exceptional intelligence. This analogy carries forward to the distinction
	between EVERYDAY and GENIUS creativity (or to rephrase it slightly,
	p-creativity and h-creativity).
	
	Ignaz Semmelweiss: Semmelweiss advocated (1847) that the practice

	up in an asylum. (p25)
	
	Reminder: three types of creativity - Combinational (unfamiliar combinations
	of familiar ideas) - hard for computers / easier for us - Exploratory
	(exploring a constrained conceptual space) - easier for computers
	/ ok for us - Transformational creativity (changing the constraints
	of a conceptual space) - restricted by how a computer is programmed

	not only advanced AI skills but also expertise in, and deep insights
	into, the domain concerned.''\cite[p. 27]{bodenAIM09} Still not sure
	if I agree with this. Boden offers no justification of this, just
	treats it as fact.
	
	Boden offers an answer to the criticism levelled at computational
	creativity: that ``a computer does what its program tells it to do
	- and no more.'' ... ``That thought is of course correct. But what
	it ignores is that the program may include rules \textit{for changing
	itself}. That is, it may contain genetic algorithms.''\cite[p. 29]{bodenAIM09}
	[``of course''...][could contain other ways of acting beyond explicitly
	programmed instructions e.g. statistical generalisations from corpus
	learning e.g. YQX, my ICMC system]
	
	p. 33 Discussing the creativity of Cope's Emmy system (CMMC, Cope
	2006), and the destruction of the Emmy database (p. 364 of CMMC):
	
	``even those who did appreciate Emmy's scores [for their musicality]
	tended to regard them not as \textit{music} but as \textit{computer
	output}. As such, they were seen as infinitely reproducible - and
	devalued accordingly.'' 
	
	This point is discussed more in the special edition of Digital Creativity
	2007 (18(1) - Authenticity and Computer Art). Boden points out that
	now Emmy's database is destroyed, Emmy's works pre-destruction (2006)
	cannot be replicated. She hints at the implication that as a result,
	they now no longer become devalued, or at least regain some of the
	lost value. },

	MEANS DEFYING ANY PRESCRIBED NOTION Chapter 1 Section on the Mystery
	of creativity - being unpredictable stops rigorous systematic scientific
	study Creativity has a paradoxical nature.
	
	* WE DON'T UNDERSTAND OR ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSCIOUS OF OUR OWN CREATIVE
	PROCESSES - difficult to self-report creative processes- tacit mental
	processes and much tacit knowledge Poincare: 4 phases of creativity
	- some are conscious, some unconscious. This links in with the debate
	about the interplay between conscious and unconscious mental processes
	during creativity, debated in \citeA{williams67}.
	
	If something is to be deemed creative, then the way it is generated
	should contradict an existing collection of generative constraints
	of a `creative unconscious' (repeatedly referred to e.g. p. 142,
	p. 151). [\cite{williams67} discusses the interplay between conscious
	and unconscious, disagreeing with the stance of Wallas, Poincare,
	Helmholtz, Hadamard and others, as well as Boden herself. but arguing
	along similar lines to Weisberg.]
	
	[p. 29 `creativity cannot be explained by conscious processes alone']
	p. 125: `unconscious influences' on creativity (and the negative
	effect on self-reporting creativity). p. 125: computer programs have
	a `feel' about them that is very unlike what artists or scientists
	say when they try to descibe their own creative moments! - goes on
	to say- is that just because subconscious human processes (that people
	can't access or report) must be implemented and therefore made conscious?
	
	Is consciousness necessary for creativity? And does this exclude subconscious
	contributions? (as \citeA{williams67} argues) Boden is happy to accept
	the role of the subconscious/unconscious mind in creativity \cite{poincare29,wallas26,hadamard45},
	asking whether we know that we evaluate creative ideas consciously.
	Boden would completely disagree with \cite{williams67}.
	
	Part of creativity is conscious realisations of intuitive knowledge
	e.g. Cohen's awareness that a key aspect of colouring is brightness,
	rather than colour - an insight which he'd known tacitly long before
	but hadn't consciously acknowledged.
	
	David Perkins has looked for evidence of the incubation phase beyond
	introspective reports. Perkins also criticises the amount of the
	creative process explained away as being unconscious, proposing heuristics
	for more efficient self-report around the thinking that we are conscious
	of a lot more of our mind's processing than we realise, but that
	we seldom voice or analyse this processing and are only conscious
	of many thoughts for a brief period of time as they flash through
	our consciousness.
	
	* MULTI-FACETED NATURE OF CREATIVITY - MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF/VIEWS
	OF CREATIVITY Boden asserts that it isn't possible to have a single
	definition that covers all interpretations of creativity, as there
	are different types. - psychological vs historical - improbabilist
	vs impossibilist - exploratory vs combinational vs transformational
	
	[BUT there is an overall concept of creativity that we can discuss
	and think about without problem? Iris Asaf \cite{asaf09} would argue
	that because we can conceive of this, therefore it exists in some
	form.]
	
	In the BBS precis \cite{boden94precis} Boden says that artistic creativity
	and scientific creativity are different, more in how creative work
	is evaluated than in how it is generated [can't find this in the
	2004 chapter?]. [Difference in our perception is down to our lack
	of specialist knowledge vs more accessible look at art?]
	
	Exploratory creativity is less radical than transformational but it
	is still important because exploring a new conceptual space helps
	to establish the value of the space, by seeing what potential it
	has for development - a new space is more useful if it has greater
	potential for exploratory creativity.
	
	Boden says how creativity is multi-faceted, with many different mental
	capacities needed.
	
	`it is usually unhelpful to ask ``Is that idea creative: \emph{yes}
	or \emph{no}?'', because creativity exists in many forms, and on
	many levels.'\cite[p. 302]{boden04}
	
	Creativity is not a discrete or boolean quality, or even continous,
	but is multi-dimensional. `Creativity isn't an all-or none property.
	It isn't even a continuously graded (\emph{more}/\emph{less}) one.
	Many human thoughts ... are so complex that one should rather ask
	\emph{Is it creative in this way? Is it creative in that way? Just
	what aspect/s of it is/are creative, and why?}'\cite[p. 313]{boden04}
	
	* DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY Dictionary definition: ``to bring into
	being or form out of nothing''
	
	The precis in Behavioral and Brain Sciences mentions \citeA{taylor88}
	which mentions over 60 definitions of creativity in the psychology
	literature. 
	
	Anything H-creative is P-creative by definition; h-creativity = p-creativity
	+ historic novelty [My thesis focusses on p-creativity, as do most
	computationalists, due to the huge practical problems involved in
	modelling all of human knowledge in a form a computer can consult.]
	
	\cite[p. 41]{boden04} `Fundamental' creativity = novelty + valuable
	+ surprising (in terms of possibility)
	
	Talks about the radicality of novelty - distraction between mere novelty
	(`exploratory' (follows rules). Bundy picks this concept up) and
	a radical surprise (transformational (redefines rules <- or wouldn't
	be possible to generate)
	
	Koestlers bisociation of matrices - bisociation: cf Boden's association/analogy/exploration/transformation
	- matrices: cf Boden's conceptual spaces
	
	Transformational creativity - to reject rules, someone has to understand
	them (ties into creative intention) - its not enough to just not
	be aware of the constraint, the constraint has to be rejected - Methods
	of transformation - dropping constraint(s) - negating constraint(s)
	
	Analogy as key for associative creativity (follows on from the emphasis
	in \cite{boden87})
	
	Creativity isn't just new ideas but also incorporates the development
	and refinement of these ideas, cf the validation stage of \citeA{wallas26,poincare29}.
	e.g. Torrance's operational definition of creativity \cite{torrance67}.
	
	* CREATIVITY AS SEARCH
	
	Mere association and analogy - like mere novelty and radical surprise
	(what is the difference between novelty and surprise) mere novelty
	- not a long journey from known to unknown radical surprise - huge
	leaps involving new ways of making the journey
	
	Boden equates transformational creativity with `cheating the rules',
	to some extent at least - changing the search space.
	
	Creative cognitive processes operate within a conceptual space (a
	domain of knowledge that can be traversed and explored)
	
	* MYSTIQUE OF CREATIVITY Mysterious interpretation of creativity has
	been explained in terms of ``divine inspiration'' (or some kind of
	muse)
	
	* RESISTANCE TO COMPUTATIONAL CREATIVITY Boden poses what she terms
	as four Lovelace questions, in response to Ada Lovelace's historical
	observations about the computer of her time (adding machines) only
	being capable of doing what humans program them to do. These questions
	are paraphrased below: 1. Can computational models help us to understand
	creativity? 2. Can a computer \emph{appear to} be creative? [this
	is followed up in \cite{colton08}] 3. Can a computer appear to recognize
	creativity? 4. Can a computer \emph{really} be creative?
	
	Boden argues that the first three questions can be answered positively.
	She sidesteps the fourth question, de-emphasising its importance
	and deliberately not addressing it until the final chapter. The reason
	given for this is that unlike questions 1-3, question 4 is not scientific
	but is philosophical, so requires a different treatment. The focus
	of this book is on how these questions can be addressed scientifically.
	p. 137: `connectionist computation as an answer to Lovelace objection
	of pre-programming - behaviour emerges though not pre-programmed
	explicitly.
	
	Randomness helps for unpredictability (escaping the `pre-programmed
	perception of computer algorithms).
	
	Even deterministic systems can be unpredictable, as illustrated for
	example by chaos theory. [cf the anecdotal view of a frustrated programmer
	asking why their program is not doing what it is supposed to do -
	although rather than a display of the computer's creativity or freewill
	and intentions, this would be due to a discrepancy between what the
	programmer thinks they have implemented, against what they have actually
	written, or between the expected and actual functionality of the
	computer hardware or programming language].
	
	This chapter addresses two debates: 1. The fourth Lovelace question:
	can a computer actually be creative? 2. Does scientific study of
	creativity destroy our sense of wonderment about and mystical impressions
	of creativity?
	
	`a scientific psychology does not deny creativity: it explains it'\cite[p.
	277]{boden04}
	
	`Forget computers, for the moment: the conviction is that \emph{any}
	scientific account of creativity would lessen it irredeemably. Even
	an explanation in terms of brain-processes (never mind silicon-chips)
	would undermine our respect for creative thought.'\cite[p. 277]{boden04}
	
	Boden follows this by describing what she terms as `anti-scientific
	prejudice' \cite[p. 278]{boden04}: the `widespread feeling that science,
	in general, drives out wonder. Wonder is intimately connected with
	creativity. All creative ideas, by definition, are valued in some
	way. Many make us gasp with awe and delight. ... To stop us marvelling
	at the creativity of Bach, Newton, or Shakespeare would be almost
	as bad as denying it altogether. Many people, then, regard the scientific
	understanding of creativity more as a threat than a promise.'\cite[p.
	278]{boden04} The ease with which we anthropomorphise computers \cite{reeves02,mccarthy79},
	assigning them human characteristics, may be contributory to the
	negative impressions we have of computational creativity. Creativity
	is generally considered a positive thing, as is illustrated by the
	volume of materials on how to improve your own creativity, and also
	as borne out in the survey results with improvisers who see creativity
	as a positive thing\footnote{Notwithstanding the acknowledgement
	of a `dark side' of creativity \citeA{kaufman09}, where creativity
	can be manifested in a negative way. For example one could argue
	that Hitler or the `September 11' bombers in New York were creative,
	although the atrocious consequences of their actions would provoke
	negative reactions to this conclusion vastly in excess of any distaste
	towards computational creativity.}
	
	Why cannot a computer be creative? \cite[p. 7]{boden04} - programmer
	being creative, not the program - No intention: the computer is merely
	executing instructions blindly with no appreciation of the semantics
	behind the instructions (c.f. Searle's Chinese Room argument \cite{searle80})
	- We can't identify with computational creativity: `A work of art
	is an expression of human experience and/or a communication between
	human beings, so machines simply don't count.'\cite[p. 7]{boden04}
	
	The issue of whether a computer is creative is side-stepped by Boden,
	who asserts that it is more important to see if computers can \emph{appear
	to be} creative. This thread is later continued by Colton \cite{colton08}.
	
	
	`He [Cohen] is greatly irritated by the fact that the exhibition audience
	was less interested in what AARON was painting than in the fact that
	it washed out its own cups and cleaned its own brushes.'\cite[p.
	315]{boden04} - is this appreciation because of what we can identify
	more with? - it is more universally a human capability to wash things
	than to paint - is it that tasks such as washing out cups are less
	threatening to our perception of what makes us human, because washing
	equipment is seen as a mechanical task not requiring creativity,
	whereas creative behaviour is something we associate strongly with
	people? - is this appreciation prompted by the surprise of the audience
	in seeing AARON in action; although they were prepared to see AARON
	painting they were not necessarily expecting to see AARON tidying
	up after itself.
	
	* GENIUS VS EVERYDAY CREATIVITY Poincare, Hadamard, Helmholtz and
	Wallas assume genius creativity e.g. Archimedes with the Eureka moment.
	
	
	Koestler - everyday creativity for everyone - not elite only - highlights
	creativity in everyday and layman experiences In the genius vs everyday
	creativity debate, Boden focusses on everyday layperson (laycomputer?)
	creativity rather than specialist expert creativity, saying creativity
	is not just a special attribute of the few.
	
	Despite Boden concentrating on everyday creativity rather than that
	of a special, particularly gifted subset of people, she often goes
	on to illustrate her ideas with examples of genius creativity `All
	creative ideas, by definition, are valued in some way. Many make
	us gasp with awe and delight. ... To stop us marvelling at the creativity
	of Bach, Newton, or Shakespeare would be almost as bad as denying
	it altogether. Many people, then, regard the scientific understanding
	of creativity more as a threat than a promise.'\cite[p . 278]{boden04}
	
	Another example is where Boden justifies scientific study of creativity
	as giving us a greater appreciation of genius: if we can develop
	scientifically a better understanding of the processes of creative
	geniuses such as Poincar`'e and others, then surely this helps us
	to further appreciate these talents (and more generally, the power
	of the human mind)?
	
	* CONTEXT OF CREATIVITY/CREATIVE ENVIRONMENT \cite[p. 74]{boden04}`To
	be appreciated as creative. a work of art or a scientific theory
	has to be understood in a specific relation to what preceded it.'
	[CONTEXT] Boden's acknowledgement of social or environmental influences
	on creativity in \citeA{boden04} are notable for their absence. *
	DEVELOPMENT OF CREATIVITY [Contrary to Ken Robinson's argument that
	children are educated out of being creative] - Annette Karmiloff-Smith
	(Cognition articles 1986/1990) found that younger children struggled
	to draw `impossible' concepts e.g. 2-headed man, but this ability
	to conceive of the impossible improves during the years. [How does
	this match to Edward De Bono's findings?]
	
	* CREATIVITY AS PROBLEM-SOLVING One of the revisions made by Boden
	in the revised 2004 edition is to consider the perception of creativity
	as problem solving, looking at story generation as a sample domain.
	MINSTREL \cite{turner94} and TALE-SPIN \cite{meehan81} think of narrative
	generation as constructing a solution to the problem: what the story
	would be if given set of parameters $x$. This approach is challenged
	by BRUTUS \cite{bringsjord00} which uses a heuristical approach.
	[The creativity-as-problem-solving approach is also considered, for
	example, in \citeA{mccarthy79} and outside of computational creativity
	e.g. \citeA{weisberg88}]},

	1999) starting to feature in AI Domain specialist knowledge vs general
	principles of creativity - combining ideas [combinatorial] - explanatory
	- transformative AISB used GOFAI rules-based AI, connectionist (neural

	heel of AI research on creativity" (p11) MB suggests that AISB99
	papers should be judged on (amongst other things) the authors' consideration
	of how their systems automatically evalute their products "My own
	view is that the Achilles' heel of AI research on creativity is not
	so much the generation of novel ideas as the automatic evaluation
	of them, once they have arisen. At present, the evaluation is usually
	implicit in the generative procedure itself [*]. The rules usually
	ensure that very few, if any, unacceptable[**] are produced by the
	system. To enable AI-models to evaluate their own ideas, especially
	those produced as a result of transformational creativity - which,
	by definition, breaks some of the accepted rules, is a tall order.
	Not because computers can't "really" value anything (that may be
	so, but it is a philosophical rather than a scientific point), but
	because we find it even more difficult to articulate our aesthetic
	values clearly than to define the rich conceptual spaces concerned.
	Even symmetry and simplicity, for instance, are notoriously difficult
	to define. And we can also value broken symmetries, and baroque complexity.
	How can AI-research do justice to such apparent contradictions? Moreover,
	our values often shift, sometimes suddenly and unpredictably. Both
	simplicity and complexity are at one end of the spectrum of endurability,
	backward-facing baseball caps - I hope - are at the other. One of
	the dimensions on which these [AISB99] papers should be judged is
	the extent to which they are aware of these sorts of problem. To
	have said the extent to which they solve them would have been, for
	the moment, to demand too much. And to have asked whether any of
	these current programs can lead us to change our values would have
	been even more stringent. Persuading others that a new and shocking
	idea is both intelligible and valuable is often a tricky and time-consuming
	matter, even for human beings. (Remember Semmelweiss, or the Salon
	des Refus\acute{e}s?) A really convincing AI-model of creativity
	out to be able to do just that. - But please: don't hold your breath!"

	is creative change over time and according to the social context
	of that time. These changes aren't always routine or predictable.
	"human values-and therefore the novelties which we are prepared to
	approve as ``creative" - change from culture to culture, and from
	time to time. In some cases, they do so in unpredictable and irrational
	ways: think of the fashion-industry, for example, or of rogue memes
	like the back-to-front baseball-cap. Nor are value-shifts confined
	to trivial cases such as these: even Bach, Mozart, and Donne were
	ignored and/or criticized in certain periods." Boden 1998 p.354 problem
	with AI systems performing self evaluation: they need to know what
	criteria they are evaluating against, or what sort of thing should
	be prized. "There is no reason in principle why future AI-models
	should not embody evaluative criteria powerful enough to allow them
	to transform their conceptual spaces in fruitfully creative (including
	H-creative) ways. But for such computerized self-criticism to be
	possible, the programmers must be able to express the values concerned
	sufficiently clearly for them to be implemented. Even if the values
	are not predetermined, being represented instead as an evolving fitness
	function, the relevant features must be implemented in and recognized
	by the (GA) system." Boden 1998 p.354 A common part of creativity
	is to challenge underlying assumptions within a creative domain and
	work in that domain from a different perspective (Boden's conceptual
	space transformation). However as the domain perspective is altered,
	this may impact the evaluative criteria or standards. How can the
	AI-model keep up with changes in standards? "To some extent, this
	[programmers expressing evaluative criteria to their AI-models] can
	be achieved implicitly, by defining a culturally accepted conceptual
	space so successfully that any structure that can be generated by
	the program will be accepted by humans as valuable [5,14]. But the
	structures generated within newly transformed spaces will need types
	of evaluation different (at least in part) from those implicit within
	the original space, or previously provided in explicit form." Boden
	1998 p.354 not always easy to see what those standards are at any
	one time "It is even more difficult to express (verbally or computationally
	just what it is that we like about a Bach fugue, or an impressionist
	painting, than it is to recognize something as an acceptable member
	of one of those categories. And to say what it is that we like (or
	even dislike) about a new, or previously unfamiliar, form of music
	or painting is even more challenging." Boden 1998 p.354 "Identifying
	the criteria we use in our evaluations is hard enough. Justifying,
	or even (causally) explaining, our reliance on those criteria is
	more difficult still. For example, just why we like or dislike something
	will often have a lot to do with motivational and emotional factors-considerations
	about which current Al has almost nothing to say." Boden 1998 p.354
	"The important point is that what scientists count as ``creative'',
	and what they call a ``discovery'', depends largely on unarticulated
	values, including social considerations of various kinds. These social
	evaluations are often invisible to scientists. For sure, they are
	not represented in AI-models." Boden 1998 p. 355 },

  annote = {In Part V [New Thoughts From Old] along with chapters on Learning
	and Problem Solving. Book contains 6 parts: intro to AI, The Personal
	Dimension (`neurotic'/`ideological' machines), Language and Understanding,
	the Visual World, this , The Relevance of AI Boden comments in 1999
	AISB keynote that people at the time were surprised that she included
	a chapter on creativity in this book. 2nd edition - MB (writing in
	1986) would only make ``minor adjustments'' to the 1977 version of
	the chapter - would now include discussion of programs that use ``heuristic
	exploration'' (p. xii) e.g. for experiments with genetic engineering
	and chip design. Creativity chapter: - Creating within a convention
	- Fiction and Frames - Analogical Thinking - Changing Representations
	[based around linguistic creativity (narrative generation and analogising)
	and representational questions (in particular, re-representation)
	rather than more general basis] Creating within a convention ---
	[the whole of the first (of four) sections is an in-depth analysis
	of how to write a better story telling program: ``creating within
	a convention'' becomes within a story-telling/narrative convention?
	Fiction and Frames --- Constraints established by your frame of reference,
	which sets the context in which you interpret what you see/hear/experience.
	Frames: MB references Minsky ``A Framework for Representing Knowledge''
	in The Psychology of Computer Vision ed. P.H. Winston, New York:
	McGraw-Hill, 1975, p. 211-277. A lot of the discussion in this chapter
	is either on describing existing narrative generation systems or
	on problem-solving/convergent thinking rather than creativty - i.e.
	looking for one right answer (though the way in which this answer
	is arrived at is creative) e.g. the riddle posed by Boden (p. 308)
	- what is the answer to the riddle. Although many reasonable answers
	can be suggested, Boden describes a single solution to the riddle
	(with the impression given that all other potential solutions are
	incorrect). Analogical Thinking --- The third section of the chapter
	is on analogy and how connections can be drawn between two things
	that seem unrelated or different. ``The question therefore arises
	whether analogical thinking is a necessary aspect of intelligence,
	whether it enables an intelligent system do something that otherwise
	it could not have done so economically, or perhaps could not have
	done at all.'' \cite[p. 315]{boden87} MB doesn't really say much
	else about exactly why the ability to use analogies is important
	for creativity, except for describing it as an important function
	to cope with natural language understanding as it evolves (i.e. linguistic
	creativity -p315). The depth of analysis (of a large number of examples
	given in the chapter) doesn't match the power of the justification
	for including such a large section on analogical systems. As MB says,
	analogising is important for dealing with new usage of language but
	it is proportionally overrepresented in this chapter, in my opinion,
	probably because a relatively large number of systems exist to be
	talked about, in comparison to other types of creative systems. After
	9 pages of discussion of various systems (then followed by more of
	the same), MB highlights two creative applications of analogy: 1.
	moving from known to unknown to gain knowledge 2.Explain and understand
	new knowledge by relating it to familar concepts Changing Representations
	--- A problem may be easier to solve if represented in a different
	way. Problem solving can be creative (even if looking for one right
	answer), due to the processes involved in getting a solution. Here
	MB highlights how re-representing a problem in a new format can require
	creativity. There is very little in the way of computational work
	here; instead MB reports more philosophically-bent discussions or
	reports on human achievements in this area (e.g. Spinoza, Kekule),
	with reference to some AI techniques such as planning and heuristics.
	This section is written so that it leads into the next chapter (on
	Problem Solving). There is no general summary of the Creativity chapter.
	The Postscript chapter houses the additions made to the 1977 edition
	in 1987, encapsulated in this chapter rather than spread throughout
	the 1977 text. MB again highlights representation generation/exploration
	and analogical reasoning as the key computational issues for creativity
	- does this fit in with her exploration/combinational/transformational
	framework (TCM)? - representation generation (of new representations
	of a problem) = transformational - representation exploration = exploration
	analogical reasoning =? combinatorial creativity? The Automatic Mathematician
	(AM, by D.Lenat) is held up as example of what MB advocates as the
	best type of machine creativity work being done - using and adapting
	``heuristics for generating and evaluating novel concepts'' (p493).
	ooh... ``an AI program presented without careful theoretical analysis
	of just what it is doing, and how, may be superficially impressive
	but basically trivial.'' \cite[p. 494]{boden87}},

	as a social process than as an individual act. 
	
	These reasons include the subjectivity of evaluation in attributing
	creativity, the potentially arbitrary relationship between individuals
	and creativity at the cultural level, the importance of the capacity
	for preserving cultural information over and above the capacity to
	innovate, the role of objects, institutions and interaction in sparking
	creativity, and the social constructedness of creative domains. 
	
	I consider the consequences of this way of thinking for research into
	computational creativity. 
	
	I argue that realising the goals of computational creativity depends
	on integrating research on creative agents with social technologies.},
  annote = {Argues that we should pay more attention to cultural influences and
	the role of the collective, in modelling creativity, and that an
	agent-based approach is needed to simuate a creative community appropriately.
	
	Bown criticises computational creativity approaches for focussing
	on creativity of an individual (`individualist cognitive science'\cite[p.
	1]{bown09}) in preference to creativity in a socio-cultural context
	(`distributed, social approach'\cite[p. 2]{bown09}).
	
	
	Csikszentmihalyi (1996) - individual creativity is only recognised
	via the people involved in that activity (the field and the domain)
	
	`Csikszentmihalyi argues that it is impossible to conceive of an objective
	measurement of creativity based only on the action of an individual
	with respect to an existing domain. We have no objective grounds
	upon which to determine how creative something is, and must rely
	on individual responses to the behaviour in question, such as collective
	or expert evaluations. Therefore, an evaluation of creativity must
	be the result of a group's response to the individual's activity.
	Correspondingly, Csikszentmihalyi defines creativity as the process
	of changing a domain.'\cite[p. 3]{bown09}
	
	Is a Picasso, who works locked away in a room and never displays his
	output, less creative than Picasso as we know him? More accurately,
	is locked-away Picasso _perceived_ as less creative than his unhidden

	from external sources, inspiration from the external world, constructive
	feedback during his creative workings, etc?]},

	Associate Professor Andrew R. Brown (Music, Queensland University
	of Technology, Australia) Generation in Context: Musical Enquiry
	through Algorithmic Music Making In this seminar I will discusses
	the use of generative music practice as a method for research. We
	have formalised an aspect of this approach we call, Generation in
	Context (GIC), designed to interrogate theories of music analysis
	and music perception. The GIC method involves building a computational
	model of a music-analytical or music-perceptual theory, and inverting
	the model (from analytical to generative) to create new musical works.
	The characteristics of these new works can be assessed against outcomes
	predicted by the theories. This approach seeks to support the understanding
	of music by bringing together the study of music perception and algorithmic
	composition. Our objectives are to: (i) Use algorithmic composition
	systems to interrogate models of music perception or music theory,
	and (ii) Develop improved algorithmic compositional techniques by
	incorporating models of music perception. I will outline some explorations
	using generative processes for music research, and will discuss how
	generative processes provide evidence as to the veracity of theories
	about how music is experienced, with insights into how these theories
	may be improved and, concurrently, provide new techniques for music
	creation.},

	theory, the method consists of creating a generative process that
	implements the theory in reverse. Instead of using the theory to
	create analyses from scores, the theory is used to generate scores
	from analyses. Subjective evaluation of the quality of the musical
	output provides a mechanism for testing the theory in a contextually
	robust fashion. The method is exploratory, meaning that in addition
	to testing extant theories it provides a general mechanism for generating
	new theoretical insights. We outline our initial explorations in
	the use of generative processes for music research, and we discuss
	how generative processes provide evidence as to the veracity of theories

  title = {What is the Difference between Real Creativity and Mere Novelty?},
  journal = {Behavioural and Brain Sciences},
  year = {1994},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {533-534},
  number = {3},
  annote = {This is a paper published in 1994 as part of a collection of commentaries
	on Margaret Boden's 'The Creative Mind' book, which had been published
	4 years previously. (At some point I really need to sit down with
	this entire journal section and read through it, when I know the
	Boden book better...)
	
	Alan Bundy has seized on two distinct concepts from Boden's book,
	of 'real creativity' and 'mere novelty', and has critically examined
	both Boden's viewpoint and other ideas on the distinction between
	these two.
	
	Boden's definitions of the two, as quoted by Bundy, are:
	
	Real creativity: "mapping, exploration and transformation of conceptual
	space" Mere novelty: "Generation of new objects from existing conceptual
	space"
	
	(I haven't found these exact quotes in the Boden book yet so can't
	add page numbers yet)
	
	From reading the paper, I think that Bundy's point is that the difference
	between the two (definition wise) is that real creativity involves
	some changing of the conceptual space parameters (i.e. the realm
	of all possible ideas in that domain). So he challenges Boden, saying
	that real creativity can be present even when new ideas are generated
	without changing the conceptual space. However I think Boden's definition
	of real creativity acknowledges this, under the use of the words
	'mapping' and exploration'?
	
	This paper does give a very thought-provoking discussion of what is
	needed to justify labelling something novel as being creative. Bundy
	suggests that the complexity of new objects being generated is important
	in how creative they are perceived to be, and that there has to be
	some kind of self reflection on the part of the creator, to judge
	the worthiness of such new objects. 
	
	Some points for consideration: Why isn't mere novelty creative? Is
	this the right distinction to be making? What is creativity if it
	isn't just mere novelty? (the paper deliberately only hints at an
	answer to this question rather than attempting to solve it comprehensively;
	little has been done to follow up Bundy's suggestions). Assuming
	creativity must incorporate novelty, what must else it have to distinguish
	itself as definitely creativity rather than just the generation of
	novel but uncreative ideas?
	
	I can't find the definition of 'real creativity' that Bundy cites,
	in Boden's book, although I can find the definition of mere novelty
	easily enough. I would like to see this definition for myself in
	Boden's own words.
	
	Interesting sentence: '"Real" intelligence appears to arise from the
	interplay of a number of relatively mundane processes.' (preceeded
	by: 'it is usually a mistake to regard one aspect of an intellectual
	process as the key with the others playing only a supporting role')
	
	This sentence makes me think: is Bundy confusing creativity with intelligence
	in this paper (deliberately or accidentally) - and actually where
	is the distinction here, the dividing line?or is creativity a sub-part
	of intelligence? or is creativity = novelty+intelligence? or less
	guided? more guided?
	
	(but also this sentence links in with some ideas I have had on creativity
	emerging from concurrent processes, linked to Koestler's bisociation
	matrices perhaps....)
	
	Is Bundy presenting creativity as intelligent generation of new concepts/ideas?
	I think he is. Do I agree with this? What are the alternatives? Seems
	a logical viewpoint to have.},

	deferred until we are substantially more capable in general automated

	16-17)" The slipperiness of CREATIVITY famously led Newell et al.
	(1963) to despair of an essentialist account and propose instead
	a multi- partite definition. They suggest four intermingling criteria
	for categorizing a solution as creative: 
	
	1. The answer has novelty and usefulness (either for the individual
	or society). 
	
	2. The answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted.
	
	
	3. The answer results from intense motivation and persistence. 4.
	The answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague.
	
	
	This approach is, of course, a classic AI formulation: there is at
	its base the implicit assumption that the created artefact is an
	``answer'', and therefore that there must have been a question. In
	the creative arts and in the less empirically motivated sciences
	and mathematics, this need not be the case: creative motivation may
	be altogether less well-defined. Nevertheless, we have seen theories
	and models that embody each of these criteria at the creativity workshops,
	which we catalogue below. Most papers emphasise the first criterion,
	presenting computational models that are capable of generating outputs
	that are novel (to themselves, at least) and demonstrably useful
	(either aesthetically or analytically). An alternative view of the
	definition of computational creativity is proposed by Wiggins (2006):
	``The performance of tasks [by a computer] which, if performed by
	a human, would be deemed creative.'' This is a different kind of
	definition, because it casts creativity as a relation between the
	creator and an observer. In some contexts, this style of definition
	would be a cop-out, merely postponing the problem; in this context,
	however, it is appropriate, since creativity really is in the eye
	of the beholder." [if creativity is truly in the eye of the beholder
	then that really is a cop-out for computational creativity programmers!]

	Clifford questions whether the absence of human involvement in computational
	creativity has repercussions in how the creative act is perceived
	legally, specifically in determining whether a computer-generated
	piece of work can/should be copyrightable.
	
	\begin{quote} `The copyright axium that creativity is required for
	copyright validity is oft-times expressed, but has not been of great
	historic significance. ... Today, however, the copyright creativity
	standard is no longer as simple [because of developments in computer-generated
	creative work, both from an AI perspective and in automating human
	production processes]' \cite[p. 260]{clifford04} \end{quote}
	
	The \emph{Feist Publications, Inc v. Rural Telephone Service Co.}
	1991 Supreme Court case has determined that creativity does impact
	on copyright
	
	For the purposes of copyright, at least, Clifford argues for the importance
	of considering process in creativity, precisely because if a creative
	work is produced by computer, it should not be considered creative:
	
	\begin{quote} `If only the product is examined with no examination
	of methodology of production, it will prove impossible to separate
	human-generated creative works from those generated by sophisticated
	computer programs based on autonomus artificial intelligence techniques.
	For these latter works, it would not only be difficult to establish
	a requisite amount of intellectual creativity, it would be impossible
	to establish origin creativity. Consequently, a combination of techniques
	is needed: a creative product is apparently required, but the creativity
	in the product must be the result of a human-based creative process.'
	\cite[p. 272]{clifford04} \end{quote}
	
	intellectual creativity: having the idea (or one or more of the ideas)
	behind the creative work origin creativity: implementing the creative
	work in physical form
	
	pp. 279-280: because the Court's pronouncements in \citeA{feist91}
	do not give a definition of what they mean by creativity, the legal
	ramifications of \citeA{feist91} can make only limited contribution
	to future cases. Clifford cites a number of examples where decisions
	had to be made on the creativity present in a work, where decisions
	often contradict each other across different cases.
	
	Clifford borrows from previous legal judgements (on whether a computer
	program was a copy of another - Computer Associates International,
	Inc. v. Altai, Inc. (1992) to suggest a framework for identifying
	creativity, based on the `abstraction-confirmation-examination' tests
	proposed in the Computer Associates case:
	
	` A. Abstraction: Finding the ``Expressive Constituents'' within the
	Work ... [expressive constituents refer to the ideas expressed in
	the work] B. Confirmation: Insuring [sic] that Some of the Expressive
	Constituents Originated from a Human ... C. Examination: Did the
	Author Deliberately Decide to Do It That Way? D. Applying the Abstraction-Confirmation-Examination
	Test '\cite[pp. 291-298]{clifford04} \end{quote}
	
	This would obviously fail for identifying creativity in a computational
	creativity system, due to step B (unless it was rephrased as demanding
	that some expressive constituents should originate from a computer).},

  annote = {Introduction Assessment of Creativity in Software Artefact Generation
	in the Visual Arts A Note on Art Appreciation The Perception of Creativity
	in Software The Creative Tripod Case Studies [HR, Painting fool]
	Conclusions 
	
	Analyses current methods of assessing creativity then suggests the
	'creative tripod' [skilful, appreciative, imaginative] as a framework
	for organising creative systems, using HR and the Painting Fool as
	case studies to illustrate the framework. Process is emphasised -
	as important as products (unlike Ritchie's product-oriented recommendations).
	Later SC says about how this is more important for the Painting Fool
	than HR - as art evaluation is particular for how it takes account
	of process... [oh really? reasons for this distinction are left unsaid.]
	sometimes even more than product e.g. conceptual art "As a research
	community, we have largely focussed on assessment of creativity via
	assessment of the artefacts produced."(p. 1) Defines computational
	creativity: (p. 1) "computer programs are written to perform tasks
	which, if undertaken by people, require an element of creativity."
	Introduction provides a nice summary of computational creativity
	systems produced up till 2008.[good material for checking evaluation
	links!] literature and linguistics music pure maths the visual arts
	
	
	What factors to consider when evaluating creativity of an "artefact
	generation program" (the phrase often used in this paper): 1. assess
	the output (product) 2. assess the software functionality (process)
	[Not assess the program input? or info available to it? (does this
	fall into process?)] Two systems discussed in the paper: HR (mathematical
	discovery program) and the Painting Fool (art generator) Both designed
	with evaluation of output as part of the creative process. "In both
	cases, assessment of the creativity of the system was a guiding factor
	in its development - we wanted to show an increase in creativity
	with each new version."(p1) HR just evaluates products, Painting
	Fool developed through assessment of products and art judgement process.
	[I think this might have been historical - however Colton claims
	that "this [assessment of creativity based purely on products of
	a system] was more than adequate in the development of HR, indeed
	a driving factor has always been a desire to increase the variety
	and quality of the mathematical artefacts it outputs." [whereas in
	art assessment, people combine process and product in the assessment]
	[Q. (Why) does this distinction exist? Do we really evaluate art
	and mathematical discovery sufficiently differently for this distinction
	to be justifiable? This is left unsaid in the comparison.] "[in conceptual
	art and similar] consumers are really celebrating the creativity
	of the artist rather than the value of the artefact" (p2) SC over
	interprets this slightly ( -> therefore this is how people generally
	assess computer-generated art -> "Hence, assessing software purely
	on its output is probably misguided" (p2) [but I agree with the idea,
	just not convinced by the logic leading up to the conclusion] 
	
	Assessment of Creativity in Software 3 authors discussed: - Boden
	2003 (TCM 2nd ed): distinction between assessing product and assessing
	behaviour of a system, distinction between P-creative and H-creative,
	distinction between exploratory and transformatice creativity, how
	it leads onto Wiggins 2006's 'searching for computer creativity'
	categorisation [no real analysis of how these separate factors affect
	SC's conclusions though] - Koza - not directly assessing creativity
	but uses genetic programming to evolve high quality artefacts by
	assessing artefacts and to some extent process (how much interaction
	the software needs to be applied in a new way) - Ritchie 2007 (strangely
	listed last) "The most extensive contribution to the discussion of
	how we could assess creativity in software has come from Ritchie."
	- his framework for creativity assessment [can it really be described
	as that? I guess so...] "The most extensive contribution to the discussion
	of how we could assess creativity in software has come from Ritchie"
	(p.2) Concentration on products because... this is how humans normally
	judge the creativity of others, by what they produce conceptual art
	as a counter example? (as used in Colton 2008) [would the products
	of a conceptual artist be their process?] can't easily observe underlying
	process, which has an impact on reliability risk of circularity if
	both product and process are assessed Colton goes into more detail
	on Ritchie's suggestinos here consider innovation as a process which
	generates novel artefacts - therefore to analyse the creativity of
	an innovative process, no need to consider the process separately
	[i still don't get it...] quality (are the products good examples
	of that domain?) and novelty (are the products new examples of that
	domain? in relation to an inspiring set) "it [Ritchie's framework]
	is well-developed" (p.3) Artefact Generation in the Visual Arts Automated
	painting software such as Illustrator do not simulate things like
	higher level details of the drawing process, just the lower level
	processes of actually making marks on a page. 
	
	Art Appreciation Discussion of art appreciation in society. We base
	judgements on the artistic effort being made, the ingenuity of the
	artist and the skill required by the artist (p. 4). Point made: there
	is no one collective notion of aesthetic beauty - people's opinions
	change and artists' personal standards change as they progress through
	their career and develop their work/style. p4: thought experiment
	presented on two paintings presented at a 'Dots 2008' exhibition.
	In one, the dots are produced randomly and in the other, the dots
	have symbolism representing people's friendships with the artist.
	SC makes the point that the "art-lover" in the exhibition would want
	to buy the latter rather than the former painting. [But - does this
	thought experiment describe perception of creativity? Or just perception
	of value and worth? or appeal?] Following on from this thought experiment
	is a paragraph discussing how creativity will often be prized over
	"beauty" of the work - one extreme example cited by SC is conceptual
	art, though SC discusses how this is also important at more "modest
	positions on the scale" [on a scale of process vs product in art].
	
	
	The Perception of Creativity in Software SC discusses how computer
	artists "tend to be kept as outsiders in the art world" Possible
	reasons reluctance to accept that techniques which people prize having
	learnt could be replaced by computational versions preconception
	of engineering techniques as non-creative belief that computers can't
	do everything humans can Evidence his comms with Paul Brown cites
	June1934 edn of Meccano magazine: " "Truly creative thinking of course
	will always remain beyond the power of any machine" " reluctance
	to accept that computers could do what humans can, citing a non-photorealistic
	rendering key textbook (Strothotte and Schlechtweg 2002, p113): "
	"Simulating artistic techniques means also simulating human thinking
	and reasoning, especially creative thinking. This is impossible to
	do using algorithms or information processing systems." " 
	
	Implications Influences people's judgements when they hear that a
	computer was responsible for producing an artefact disregards the
	idea of a Turing-style test to see if people can distinguish between
	artificially produced and human produced - the question should actually
	be (for artwork) which would a person buy? [but is that actually
	testing for creativity? I think this is too much of an aside] Makes
	the point that artists essentially set their own aesthetic standards
	and see if society agrees. (p5) "Hence, fixing measures of how good
	or bad generated artefacts are is missing the point in the visual
	arts. This is only useful in the long run for software where there
	is no ambition for it to be creative in its own right" (p5) Creative
	Tripod If we assign creativity to the programmer as well as to the
	software, then this is like assigning creativity to the teacher as
	well as to the pupil ("but because the training of software is far
	more explicit than that of an arts student, it is understandable."
	(p5)) The desired result is that "the behaviour of the software cannot
	be predicted [algorithmically or otherwise] by the programmer" (p5)
	skill, imagination, appreciation (p6) "Our position is that, if we
	perceive that the software has been skillful, appreciative and imaginative,
	then, regardless of the behaviour of the consumer or programmer,
	the software should be considered creative. Without all three behviours,
	it should not be considered creative, but the more aspects which
	extend each leg of the tripod, the more creativity we should project
	onto the software." eg AARON (p5-6) because Aaron cannot appreciate
	its own work (Cohen selects rather than Aaron) then AARON is missing
	one leg of the creative tripod - it has skill and (arguably) imagination
	but not appreciation Also considers two other art programs in this
	section (Collomosse's cubist image generation software 2003 and NEvAr)
	
	
	Relating the creative tripod back to other assessment frameworks:
	- Boden: exploratory search is less imaginative than transformational
	search - Koza: the ability of software to adapt to new applications
	is a sign of greater appreciation [I think this is a bit tenuous!]
	- Ritchie: "we argue that we should be implementing Ritchie's criteria
	into artefact generation software, so that it could better appreciate
	its own creativity." (p6) Also the creative tripod is an informal
	counterpart to Ritchie's formal criteria approach. (Dan Ventura has
	followed up on this in 2008)
	
	Case Studies HR skill: can generate new concepts from existing known
	concepts or from empirical evidence, carry out proofs/disproofs imagination:
	search e.g. finding a conjecture about refactorable numbers which
	was perhaps H-creative appreciation: through its measures of interestingness
	(see Colton, Bundy and Walsh 2000) The Painting Fool (development
	guided by focussing on and maximising the tripod qualities). Different
	modules represent different legs of the tripod - not all functioning
	together though (yet) skill: versatility in various different styles
	imagination: evolutionary approach to scene generation appreciation:
	recognising emotion portrayed in portraits (later addition of a machine
	vision program to assist this and make it more autonomous) 
	
	Conclusions (p7) "Consideration of how to assess the level of creativity
	in an artefact generation program is a key issue in computational
	creativity." process is important. "we should be providing consumers
	of the artefacts with some high-level details of how the software
	operates." Problems with "assessing artefacts in a domain where the
	assessment criteria are themselves in flux" (p7-8) Autonomy in assessment
	criteria also highlighted: (p8) "software which we want to ultimately
	be accepted as creative in its own right needs to subvert any given
	notions of good and bad artefacts" Aim for creative tripod is to
	provide some standardised criteria for creativity, both for assessment/categorisation
	and for development. },

	Considers the aims for system, methods employed, results and in particular
	how the programs measure how interesting a concept/conjecture is.
	interestingness [from abstract] = - novelty - surprise - complexity
	- applicability in use - goal achievement --- Jumping to the Conclusions
	section: ---- Surveyed programs use the following measures to estimate
	interestingness in mathematical discovery: plausibility novelty surprisingness
	applicability comprehensibility utility NB Domain-specificity of
	plausibility. In pure maths, results need to be true in all cases.
	So plausibility = TRUE/FALSE rather than e.g. 80% true or some statistical
	measurement of plausibility. However in e.g. scientific discovery,
	results that were true for 80% of all data would be much more useful
	than in the pure maths domain. Usefulness is very important in mathematical
	discovery. Interestingness != Usefulness [though interestingness
	helps point towards what might be useful] [Q. Can a discovery be
	useful without being interesting? I think NO in this domain because
	if some previously undiscovered concept or conjecture is useful then
	it has interest because it can be used. Q. How about in other domains?
	Depends on what interestingness means in those domains. Q. How domain-specific
	is interestingness-and how generalised can it be? In pure maths something
	is interesting if it helps you progress, therefore interestingness
	and utility are tied together this way. Q. In other domains, can
	discoveries be useful without being interesting? yes e.g. if they
	are a means to an end and if it is not your primary concern - I guess
	this applies to maths too - most maths conjectures are not interesting
	to me - unless I can see them being useful to me or in solving a
	notorious problem. Q. Can things can be interesting without being
	useful e.g. Chicken paper is interesting but not useful except as
	amusement (so does it have some value here in its humour - which
	is of course its main purpose? Hmmm I can't think of things which
	are interesting but not useful in some sort of way...)] interestingness
	[conjectures] = - empirically true results - novelty - surprise -
	based on non-trivial models [== complexity] - understandable but
	non-trivial conjecture interestingness [concepts] = - be modellable
	- novelty - potential for possibly true conjectures [== applicability]
	- understandable - have surprising properties (esp if such property(ies)
	are not true of the parent concept) Recommendation (p. 372) that
	"the general methods highlighted here for mathematical discovery
	programs to assess their results can be applied to other scientific
	domains." Similar ideas to mine in that discovery/interestingness
	can be assessed using measures of contributory factors. Evaluation
	useful, to increase quality of output from systems (p. 372): "It
	is clearly a good strategy to identify which interesting initial
	results are output from a program and implement measures to increase
	the yield of such concepts." p. 374: "How programs estimate the interestingess
	of the concepts and conjectures they produce is central to building
	intelligent discovery programs" This is justified in p. 365-6: interestingness
	measures help: - improve efficiency of the system (save time checking
	unneeded conjectures and find better results more quickly by directing
	search towards the goal that is most interesting to the end user-"informed
	progress" (p. 366)), - improve the appeal of the output (so the program
	is seen as more successful/useful), - also interestingness measures
	could be used to predict how difficult a conjecture might be to prove
	--- Assessing interestingness --- Different definitions of interestingness
	in the same domain. NB Lenat's AM system - heuristics for measuring
	interestingness? Tests for different factors in the systems investigated:
	- empirical plausibility Use available data to try and find counter
	examples for conjectures i.e. check that no counter example can be
	found easily for a conjecture using available data. - novelty Checking
	for direct repetitions of previous conjectures [and presumably conjectures
	which repeat known conjectures in the data already]. Checking that
	a new conjecture is not a weaker result compared to a more powerful
	existing conjecture, that it is not implied anyway by an existing
	conjecture (i.e. the new conjecture is obvious, given the existing
	conjecture) (so in this situation the new conjecture offers nothing
	new) Checking that the function produces unseen output (no other
	function produces this output) NB some systems find a concept more
	interesting, the more possible definitions of this concept there
	are. although "It is important to make the distinction between one
	concept having two properties (e.g. two definitions), which is often
	interesting, and two concepts sharing the same property (e.g. a categorizatoin),
	which often detracts from the interestingness of both."(p. 367).
	In other words 1 concept => 2 properties is better than 2 concepts
	=> 1 property, as you get more information in the first case from
	less data. - surprisingness Least surprising conjecture = tautology
	- therefore avoid making tautologies (check new conjectures to see
	if they are tautologies, don't allow series of steps like two negations
	in a row [shouldn't this be under novelty?]) Using semantic information
	to measure how similar two conjectures are (HR system) and how different
	a new conjecture is from an existing conjecture [again isn't this
	novelty?] In AM, if a concept has a property that its parents do
	not have then it is more interesting [not necessarily more surprising?]
	[Surprisingness is linked into novelty - if something is seen before
	it is less surprising. But there is more to surprisingness than this
	- e.g. the result of a process may be surprising not because it is
	unseen but because it is derived in a different way.] - applicability
	matching predicates to models (the more models a predicate fits into,
	the more applicable it is) - alt: check the number of models that
	can be members of the domain set of a function/satisfy the preconditions
	of a conjecture. check how many examples a concept can generate Aim:
	maximise applicability but also parsimony - HR measure of parsimony
	- keep more specialised concepts at the expense of more widely applicable
	concepts (p. 369) "applicability is a common measure but how it is
	used is determined by the context in which the discovery task is
	attempted." - comprehensibility and complexity Portrayed as two ends
	of a spectrum. Smaller construction paths in HR system -> less complicated
	definition -> less complex. Minimise complexity, to maximise comprehensibility.
	check how much is known about a concept (e.g. how many conjectures
	there are about it, how many proofs there are for those conjectures)
	how difficult is a conjecture to prove? (in other words how complex
	is it?) can estimate likelihood of being able to prove it [though
	I don't see how??] - utility interactive input from the user as to
	how useful a concept/conjecture is (e.g. AM system) also user can
	specify a concept as a goal ("focus" concept) so any related concepts
	or conjectures are more useful. check how close a conjecture/concept
	gets us to the goal (therefore how much utility it has) --- Classifying
	interestingness measures --- interestingness measures: - pruning
	-> getting rid of rubbish e.g. HR's measure of surprisingness by
	forbidding certain series of steps and using semantic information
	to judge how similar a new concept is to existing concepts. e.g.
	several systems discard conjectures which aren't empirically plausible
	or which offer nothing new - directing -> guiding search in promising
	directions e.g. AM uses user interaction to indicate promising direction
	e.g HR measure of parsimony - keep more specialised concepts at the
	expense of more widely applicable concepts - defining -> saying what
	is interesting to the system (and in turn, what is not interesting)
	e.g. HR complexity measure (by counting no of steps towards constructing
	a conjecture/concept) e.g. 'focus' (GT/Graffiti) or goal concepts
	e.g. Bagai et al keeping only consistent concepts Also: an interestingness
	measure can be immediate [assigned straightaway and unchanging, "snapshot"
	(p. 371)] or evolving [value changes over time as new information
	comes in]},

	expense of producing novel high-valued output. Other contribution:
	to cast Ritchie's proposals as a guide for program construction rather
	than post-hoc assessment and to stress that there is no `right answer'
	in assessing how creative something is, so there is little worth

	comparison of systems). Introduction Background - Creative Programs
	- Motivation from the Philosophy of Science Contributions to Creativity
	Measures of Fine-Tuning Case Studies Conclusions and Further Work
	input knowledge <-> inspiring set? Looks that way CPR work from a
	starting point of Ritchie 2001 to derive measures of the novelty
	of the output of a program relative to the input. On comparison of
	systems against each other on how creative they are: ``Under certain
	circumstances, it may be possible to use such measures [measures
	to estimate the creativity of a program] to determine whether one
	program is more creative than another. However, the circumstances
	would have to be very special, taking the design, input and output
	of both programs into consideration, and it is still likely that
	such a comparison would be deemed unfair. ... The worth of measures
	of creativity therefore lies in using them in the design of creative
	programs rather than in the assessment of established programs. ''
	\cite[p. 1]{colton01} We as humans can still make comparisons saying
	`$x$ is more creative than $y$', even though (as \citeauthors{colton01}
	say) there is no ground truth or right answer in such a comparison.
	And in the paradigm of scientific research, how do we show progress
	in our research if we cannot compare our systems against previous
	work? In the years since the publication of this paper, each author
	of \citeA{colton01} has retracted this view that comparison between
	systems is unfair and that there is little worth in using measures
	of creativity to assess computational systems. Pease (personal communication
	2009) has shown interest in assessment methods Ritchie 2007 Colton
	2008 (aisb) "We've recently reached the stage where there is a sufficiently
	large number of such programs for us to be able to compare and contrast
	them in a meaningful way. ... A very important issue is the assessment
	of the creativity of programs. In the problem solving paradigm, if
	a new program solves a previously unsolvable problem, or solves a
	bunch of problems faster than all other programs, then clear progress
	has been made. As creativity is such a subjective notion (is your
	child really as creative as you say?), it's much more difficult for
	us to compare the creative abilities of different programs. However,
	much progress has been made towards telling whether we should use
	the word creative to describe a program and telling whether one artefact
	generation program is performing more creatively than another." (p.
	6) Assessment of creative systems: - HR's measures of interestingness
	= self-assessment - JAPE assessed by school children - MuzaCazUza
	(case-based reasoning melody generation program Ribeiro et al 2001)
	- interactive phase during generation process where user can guide
	melody development - ASPERA (poetry generation program - Gervas)
	- user feedback added to program data store for future poem generation.
	Motivation from the Philosophy of Science --- Popper (1972) says
	that a scientific theory should - not be \emph{ad hoc} [emphasis
	from \citeA{colton01} - i.e. the theory itself shouldn't be used
	as evidence to test what is being investigated, but the phenomena
	being investigated should be testable by independent evidence. -
	be content-rich - the more general the potential application of a
	theory, the more valuable it is and the more content it has. (and
	also that it should ``logically [entail] what it explains'' (p. 3)
	\citeauthor{colton01} set these points in the context of creative
	programs - treating the program as the theory to be tested and the
	program output as the phenomena being investigated, concluding that
	programs should be made as general as possible and the value of the
	program should be based on criteria beyond the fact that it generates
	specifically-targeted artefacts. Many of the ad-hoc methods being
	used by computational systems for evidence are examples of the first
	point by Popper - they test for the presence of creativity using
	evidence that is going to be present anyway as part of the way the
	program is being implemented. For example, the creativity of the
	narrative generation system presented in \citeA{hassan07} is discussed
	not in general terms (applicable and comparable to any creative system)
	but in terms of the creativity of the following aspects of the program
	implementation: - world construction - story construction - content
	planning - sentence planning The point of this paper is to add to
	Ritchie's criteria with measures estimating the amount of 'fine-tuning'
	(i.e. overfitting to the input data) and estimating the generality
	of the program. As for Ritchie's criteria, this approach relies on
	knowing what makes up the inspiring set (the artefacts that guide
	the program construction, either directly or implicitly); if the
	members of the inspiring set are unknown or undocumented, then applying
	the measures becomes problematic. The measure of fine-tuning is based
	on the assumption that programs can use different input sets, and
	that varying the input set may affect the outcome. Like Ritchie,
	CPR reward programs that produce ``novel high-valued items'' \cite[p.
	4]{colton01}. Fine-tuning is defined as ``the case where input knowledge
	causes a program to replicate known items to a greater extent than
	it causes the generation of novel high-valued items'' (p. 4), cf
	overfitting to the training data. CPR contradict themselves by applying
	their measures to case studies to illustrate them in use, when they
	have repeatedly said that the measures are not for post-hoc analysis
	but for guiding program construction. In this context, a better way
	to illustrate the measures in use would be by constructing a new
	system using the measures as a guide. In the Conclusions section,
	CPR repeat their point that fine-tuning in creative programs is a
	problem (whilst acknowledging that there is a value in simulating
	already-discovered artefacts, this value is to be found in investigating
	the process of discovery in order to produce new discoveries). ``we
	have noted that the more fine-tuned a program is, the less creativity
	we attribute to it.'' \cite[p. 6]{colton01}. The paper contributions
	are intended to assist people writing new creative programs rather
	than performing analysis of existing programs. This approach does
	rely on the existence of an inspiring set, although the authors (perhaps
	rather hopefully) claim that people writing new systems can and would
	document what their inspiring set is during program construction.
	Weakening or adapting this reliance is highlighted by the authors
	as an area for further work. ``The assessment of machine creativity
	is beginning to be recognised as an important area of this field,
	with general guidelines such as those in (Pease, Winterstein, \&
	Colton 2001) required as well as concrete measures, such as those
	presented in (Ritchie 2001) and those derived here. Such measures
	are imperative if the study of machine creativity is to become a
	formal research programme. Furthermore, we hope that such notions
	will be very useful for researchers writing creative programs in
	the future.'' \cite[p. 6]{colton01}},

	AISB99 symposium on AI and scientific creativity, but cast in a wider
	perspective. The symposium papers are discussed alongside considerations
	of current themes in research into scientific creativity: - theoretical
	frameworks (inc borrowing from philosophy, psychology and case studies)
	- relevant computational frameworks - existing work in this area
	and existing results --- Introduction --- --- Frameworks for Scientific
	Creativity [philosophical frameworks, historical case studies, psychological
	studies] --- --- Considerations for Machine Discovery [computational
	frameworks] --- Key considerations for scientific creative programs:
	discovery and justification. Both highly necessary components. ---
	- Computational Frameworks --- --- - Assessing Machine Discoveries
	[*****] --- V. important for scientifically creative programs: how
	programs perform self-evaluation on their results to identify the
	best and discard the useless. Interesting point made that immediate
	assessment isn't always a true assessment as often the contribution
	of a system/idea/person develops over time. So potential must be
	considered as well. Simon Colton's symposium paper addresses this
	by assessing 5 sci.creativity programs and focussing on their 'interestingness'
	- this paper goes onto be a journal paper - Colton et al 2000 in
	Int J HCS) Discusses each of the following factors were common for
	interestingness [and how they are measured]: - empirical plausibility,

	behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but,
	considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory. We review the emerging
	literature and take stock of several long-standing theories and widely
	held beliefs about creativity. A total of 72 experiments, reported
	in 63 articles, make up the core of the review. They broadly fall
	into 3 categories: divergent thinking, artistic creativity, and insight.
	Electroencephalographic studies of divergent thinking yield highly
	variegated results. Neuroimaging studies of this paradigm also indicate
	no reliable changes above and beyond diffuse prefrontal activation.
	
	
	***** These findings call into question the usefulness of the divergent
	thinking construct in the search for the neural basis of creativity.
	
	
	
	A similarly inconclusive picture emerges for studies of artistic performance,
	except that this paradigm also often yields activation of motor and
	temporoparietal regions. Neuroelectric and imaging studies of insight
	are more consistent, reflecting changes in anterior cingulate cortex
	and prefrontal areas. 
	
	***** Taken together, creative thinking does not appear to critically
	depend on any single mental process or brain region, and it is not
	especially associated with right brains, defocused attention, low
	arousal, or alpha synchronization, as sometimes hypothesized. 
	
	***** To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must be further
	subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully associated
	with specific neurocognitive processes.},

	CRITICISM OF DIVERGENT THINKING AS CREATIVITY
	
	\begin{quote} `These findings call into question the usefulness of
	the divergent thinking construct in the search for the neural basis
	of creativity.' \cite[p. 822]{dietrich10} \end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `This practice of accepting divergent thinking as proxy
	for creative thinking has been strongly criticised' \cite[p. 823]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	Two reasons for criticism: 1. Convergent thinking can also result
	in creativity (e.g. Bach's methodical approach, Mednick's Remote
	Associates Test) 2. Divergent thinking does not always result in
	creativity (no guarantee)
	
	\begin{quote} `Despite these drawbacks, and perhaps because of a lack
	of alternatives, tests of divergent thinking ... are the most widely
	used methods for assessing creativity. More than half of all experiments
	reviewed in the present study exploit this paradigm.' \cite[p. 823]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	Although being dismissive of the definition of creativity as divergent
	thinking, \citeA{dietrich10} does employ this definition at one point,
	possibly for convenience in trying to explain a wider point about
	where creativity is present in the brain: \begin{quote} `both EEG
	and neuroimaging experiments fail to support the notion that divergent
	thinking, \emph{and by extension creativity}, is linked to the right
	brain - or to the left brain, for that matter.' \cite[p. 833, emphasis
	added]{dietrich10} \end{quote}
	
	Later, though, they repeat their argument that divergent thinking
	tests are inadequate for testing creativity:
	
	\begin{quote} `It appears that such tests may be too crude a measuring
	device to make creativity tractable in the brain. Better psychometric
	instruments, along with a standardized set of control tasks, are
	mandatory.' \cite[p. 834]{dietrich10} \end{quote}
	
	
	MULTI-FACETED NATURE OF CREATIVITY
	
	\begin{quote} `creative thinking does not appear to critically depend
	on any single mental process or brain region' \cite[p. 822]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must
	be further subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully
	associated with specific neurocognitive processes' \cite[p. 822]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	
	The basic conclusions of this paper are that neuroscientific research
	is too little advanced to back up any theories such as \citeA{wallas26}.
	(A similar conclusion is reached in the earlier review by \citeA{heilman05}.)
	
	What they do conclude is that
	
	\begin{quote} `creativity is not localized, or perhaps more accurately,
	given the current neuroimaging capabilities and the theoretical resolution
	with which the issue is seen, not localizable. \cite[p. 845]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	\citeauthor{dietrich10} argue that creativity cannot be studied as
	a single standard entity: \begin{quote} `[for] proposals that posit
	a specific neurocognitive process for \emph{the whole of} creativity
	... [t]he wieght of the evidence simply does not support them. Indeed,
	any such exercise in category formation of what is and what is not
	supposed to be linked to creativity is likely doomed to failure if
	it is applied to all of creativity.' \cite[p. 845, emphasis added]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `Overall, ... the evidence reviewed in this study illustrates
	that every one of these proposals fails when generalized to creativity
	as a whole. Although this is readily acknowledged in the field, results
	from individual studies contine to be framed in terms of creativity
	in general. This is partly a mattter of language - using the word
	\emph{creativity} without circumscribing it, for instance - but it
	is also partly a matter of conceptual confusion. Creativity, or any
	of its stages, is routinely treated as if it is a single entity,
	possessing at best several different aspects and therefore comprising
	a limited set of fundamental processes or brain structures underlying
	it. This is likely to be a fallacy. ... Creativity research must
	... look at individual processes. Only when the amorphous concept
	of creativity is subdivided into different types or component processes
	broadly along the lines of known neurocognitive processes might it
	become tractable with neuroimaging tools.' \cite[p. 845]{dietrich10}
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `Once we fully commit to the idea that there are likely
	a multitude of processes and brain regions invovled in the computation
	of ideational combinations, we can better constrain our theoreticl
	notions. The present review demonstrates the need for current models
	on the neural basis of creativity to be developed further. As they
	are now, they do not yield predictions precise enough for falsification.'

	how these results identify the semantic properties that should be

	with a case study on nine near synonymous Russian verbs that, in
	combination with an infinitive, express TRY. Our approach is corpus-linguistic
	and quantitative: assuming a strong correlation between semantic
	and distributional properties, we analyze 1,585 occurrences of these
	verbs taken from the Amsterdam Corpus and the Russian National Corpus,
	supplemented where necessary with data from the Web. We code each
	particular instance in terms of 87 variables (a.k.a. ID tags), i.

	form a verb's behavioral profile. The resulting co-occurrence ta-
	ble is evaluated by means of a hierarchical agglomerative cluster

	which has been used for several years in studies of performance timing.
	This paper describes improvements to the original system and a large-scale
	evaluation and analysis of the system's performance. The beat tracking
	algorithm remains largely unchanged: BeatRoot uses a multiple agent
	architecture which simultaneously considers several different hypotheses
	concerning the rate and placement of musical beats, resulting in
	accurate tracking of the beat, quick recovery from errors, and graceful
	degradation in cases where the beat is only weakly implied by the
	data. The original time domain onset detection algorithm, which caused
	pro- blems for beat tracking music without prominent drums, has been
	replaced with a more robust onset detector based on spectral flux.
	Other new features include annotation of multiple metrical levels
	and phrase boundaries, as well as improvements in the user interface.
	The software has been rewritten entirely in Java, and it runs on
	all major operating systems. BeatRoot is evaluated on a new test
	set of 1360 musical excerpts from a wide range of Western musical
	styles, and the results are compared with other evaluations such
	as the MIREX 2006 Audio Beat Tracking Evaluation. },

	philosophy was about determining the meaning of those statements

	group were committed'.'' (p. 135 in E&E) Popper showed that verification
	was not a sound model to work from for scientific method, because
	a string of positive results showing a theory to be seemingly valid
	can be contradicted by just one result showing the theory to be false

	every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead, showing
	that more refined views as to the uniformity of nature would have
	been useful to the chicken.' '' (p. 134, E&E, p. ??? Russell ???ref)
	Instead of verification, Popper advocated falsification - a scientific
	hypothesis cannot be proven but it can be disproven. (by empirical
	evidence? as opposed to mathematical reasoning, which has a different
	set of critiques...) Popper, K. - The Logic of Scientific Discovery
	(London: Hutchinson, 1959) Has been questioned how different falsificationism
	is from verification e.g. Carnap said that Popper exaggerated the
	difference. Popper saw another difference between verification and
	falsification - verification was about distinguishing between sense
	and nonsense, whereas Popper was more interesting in distinguishing
	between science and non-science (or 'pseudoscience'): `` ` It was
	clear to me that all these people were looking for a criterion of
	demarcation not so much between science and pseudo-science as between
	science and metaphysics. And it was clear to me that my old criterion
	of demarcation was better than theirs.' '' (p. 136, E&E, p ???, Popper
	???ref) Lakatos's chapter in P. A. Schilpp's `The Libary of Living
	Philosophers - Popper' (LaSalle: Open Court, 1974) questioned falsification
	as a solution for inductive reasoning problems and the demarcation
	Popper was drawing between science and non-science. Also criticised
	by other philosophers of science - Paul Feyerabend, John Watkins,
	Joseph Agassi. Feyerabend ??? Watkins ??? Agassi, J. - A Philosopher's
	Apprentice (Amsterdam, Rodopi, 1993) p. 132 Wittgenstein had two
	'phases' of theories about language. (i) picture theory of language
	= `[theory] by which language in its structure represents the world'
	(p. 132). Heavily criticised by Popper as ` ``hopelessly and indeed
	outrageously mistaken'' ' (E&E, p, 132) in Unended Quest: An Intellectual
	Autobiography (rev edn 1986, London: Flamingo) even though this theory
	was `long-abandoned' (p. 132) - E & E discuss at several points how
	Popper may have been unaware of Wittgenstein's change of philosophical
	direction on language, e.g. pp. . Popper saw Wittgenstein as a logical
	positivist, the inspiration for views in the Vienna Circle, but Popper
	rebuffed logical positivism through his falsification theory. Wittgenstein,
	L. - Tractatus Logico- Philosophicus, trans C. K. Ogden (Routledge
	& Kegan Paul, 1922); rev trans by D. Pears and B. McGuiness (London:
	Routledge, 1961) Wittgenstein, L. - Philosophical Investigations,
	ed. E. Anscombe and G. H. von Wright (Oxford: Blackwell, 1953) [posthumous]
	The view of philosophy as the study of language as the frame through
	which we view the world - first comes from Russell. Russell looked
	at what it means to exist, be known and be true. He gave the example
	of`the King of France is bald' - we can say this and contemplate
	the baldness or not of the French monarch, even though there is no
	King of France. Russell's Theory of Descriptions is motivated by
	the problem of being able to use words to make statements about things
	which do not exist, and imply during the statement that they do exist.
	It is to answer and defeat claims by e.g. Alexius Meinong that if
	we can talk about something, then it does exist, in some metaphysical
	way (in the world of logic rather than in the world of reality).
	(Iris Asaf says something similar - has she anything novel to contribute
	to this in the way of creativity?) Russell's theory of descriptions
	state that the meaning of a word is not a label for a thing that
	exists (in some way), but that the word becomes meaningful as a constituent
	part of a statement, where the statement represents a set of (often
	complex) interlinked logical propositions. e.g. The King of France
	is bald -> There exists a King of France AND there is only one King
	of France AND for all x that are Kings of France, they are bald.
	Hence as the first proposition is false, the sentence is false, though
	its semantics can still be interpreted and stated logically. Russell
	represented this logically through the invention of the ForAll and
	ThereExists operators, and associated notation, which we still use
	in logic today. Russell (1905 - ???ref) - first mention of the bald
	French monarch... Wittgenstein was influenced by Russell in his earlier
	career, though he later thought less of Russell's work (e.g. he is
	supposed to have said during his doctoral viva to Russell and (???)
	about his work: 'Don't worry, I know you'll never understand it').
	Equally Russell was not convinced (E&E p. 187) by the ideas expressed
	by Wittgenstein in his later career (published post-humously in the
	Philosophical Investigations), dismissing these ideas as `unintelligible',
	`trivial' and `negative' (E&E p187, Russell p ??) Wittgenstein's
	earliest work - Tractatus - first statement 'The world is all that
	is the case.' and last statement 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof
	one must remain silent.' In the Tractatus, Wittgenstein strongly
	connects language, thought and reality. This is presented through
	the picture theory of language, where facts and propositions present
	(paint?) a picture of what the world is like. Such pictures reveal
	the hidden structure of what we are trying to convey with language.
	Later Wittgenstein moves from seeing pictures as a metaphor for language,
	to seeing language as a tool. Therefore the meaning of a word or
	statement is in how that language is used, rather than trying to
	understand what assigned meaning a word represents. Wittgenstein
	talks about words that appear similar but have very different functions,
	using the illustrative example of a set of crank handles for a train
	engine - which all look the same but perform very different jobs
	when used. Also, a single word can have multiple uses (and therefore
	multiple meanings) depending on context (polysemy). For this, Wittgenstein
	introduces the concept of the family resemblance. He gives an example
	of the word 'game', talking about how different types of games emphasise
	different parts of the concept 'game'. There need not be any central
	component(s), or any component shared by all types of game; indeed
	Wittgenstein suggests and rules out several candidates by finding
	counter examples e.g. competitive vs co-operative games, team vs
	individual games, skill vs luck games, etc. Wittgenstein concludes
	that there is no single `essence' that unifies all games, but like
	members of a family, although they do not all share a singular marking
	characteristic, various (varying, overlapping) family resemblances
	can be spotted between the different types of games that collectively
	identify the family, or the concept of the game. Wittgenstein likens
	this to a thread, `where the strength of the thread does not reside
	in the fact that some one fibre runs through its whole length, but
	in the overlapping of many fibres'. (E&E p181, Philosophical Investigations
	p. ???). (RELATED TO CREATIVITY) (Key point - ` ``Meaning is use''
	has proved an enduring slogan' (E&E p 232) Words' meanings are set
	by how we use the words and our language is grounded in rules set
	by our habitual use of it and our shared consensual practices. Although
	Wittengstein earlier believed, as Russell did, that language represents
	a fixed logical structure or picture that is hooked to a particular
	part of reality, later Wittgenstein took a more pragmatic view of
	language - that its meaning is what we make it, in our (consensual
	and collaborative) usage of language. Our public, shared understanding
	of language makes us interpret it the way we do - and this is not
	fixed but can evolve and change shape over time as public usage changes.
	Incidentally, Wittgenstein concluded from these views that any philosophical
	problems arising from this were actually only linguistic puzzles,
	arising from the rules and constraints set down by how we use our
	language and grammar. So if we voice a particular philosophical 'problem'
	then this problem is only extant because of how we use our language.
	This isn't a problem with the language itself, which is [quote from
	philosophical investigations?] not inherently disguising or hiding
	anything. The problem is instead with our *usage* and *application*
	of language being inadequate, hence providing us with philosophical
	puzzles that we try to solve (with language). Philosophical problems,
	however, do not exist - only these philosophical puzzles. (This was
	heavily disagreed with by other prominent philosophers e.g. Popper,
	Russell (E&E p 188)). Hence, to Wittgenstein, the problem of interpreting
	creativity becomes a mere puzzle to be solved (linguistically?),
	arising from the simple problem that our language does not have the
	rules in place to apply when interpreting what creativity is, due
	to the way in which we use language (particularly the way we use
	the word creativity). p. 184 Wittgenstein's whole (philosophical)*
	career is built around `a preoccupation with language' and with clarifying
	our language usage (p. 185). * Wittgenstein also took other work
	during his life, in teaching, army service, and elsewhere. [In distinguishing
	science from non-science, Popper's principle of falsification is
	aimed at tackling a slightly different task from the logical positivists
	who are using the principle of verification to distinguish between
	sense and nonsense. Hence something could be sensible but non-scientific,
	for example. Finding no positive examples where something is true
	(e.g. no verification) is inconclusive in demonstrating that something
	is nonsense, whereas finding no negative examples that something
	is false is inconclusive in falsifying a hypothesis. The same lack
	of closure exists?] Lakatos (ref???) has argued against falsification,
	saying that some now-validly-accepted theories have been falsified
	but that there have been experimental reasons why falsifying evidence
	has been produced. Once the experiment has been rejected, the falsifying
	result can be seen as anomalous. e.g. (potential) experiments where
	Galileo's theory of gravitational pull are `falsified', when steel
	balls of varying mass are dropped down a mine shaft - in this experiment
	the falsifying evidence can be explained away by the presence of
	iron ore in the shaft. -> theories can become too robust to be dismissed
	by one piece of falsifying evidence. Also Popper has made claims
	that the measure of worth of a hypothesis is based around how many
	predictions arise as a result of that hypothesis, and how bold these
	predictions are. Lakatos argued that it is more valuable for a theory
	to be capable of sourcing predictions which are not made by other
	theories - hence evidence is more likely to be corroborating or falsifying
	that particular theory rather than another theory which makes similar
	predictions. Hume's problem of induction (???ref) is still present.
	Popper's falsification principle still doesn't deal with how things
	can be proven true. (Lakatos e.g. - why shouldn't you jump off the
	Eiffel tower (???ref) ).},

	Giuseppe G. Englert 86 bis blvd de la Tour Mauberg F-75007 Paris,
	France I will present below a tool for composers to provoke their
	thoughts, to teach, apply criticism, and defend themselves against
	criticism. This description is a "Concept" (as I will define below)
	of such a tool. Since the description is concerned exclusively with
	the act of creation, it ignores purposefully the listener's perception
	and questions of aesthetics; only facts that can be verified in music
	are considered. No historical limitations are taken into account.
	Can the composition of music, in general, be seized by formalizations
	in words? Composition deals with abstractions, even in the case of
	electronic music or musique concrete. Not only is abstract thinking
	always present, but quite often composers are obliged to manipulate
	abstractions of abstractions ... of abstractions. It should be possible
	to attempt a formalization, at the lowest level, of work done on
	abstractions. Models, Concept, Realization Three stages can be analyzed
	in the making of a composition or an improvisation (the latter, at
	its best, is a real-time composition): the Models; a Concept; and
	the Realization. We can find Models in remembering what has been
	told to us during the years of education, in observing our environment-the
	immediate one at home or experiences of travelling-everything that
	is met during research and study if we keep eyes and ears open for
	discovery. It is obvious that observed objects are-in their totality-often
	too complex to be the starting point of a new work of art. We reduce
	the observation to a "usable" image, simplifying the recorded parameters
	to the scale of our artistic goal. The technical term for this process
	is data reduction. For example, if one examines an analysis of an
	instrumental or vocal sound sustained for approximately three seconds,
	one discovers that tens of thousands of parameter changes occur.
	To reconstruct (synthesize) the same sound in an acceptable way,
	one can reduce the analysis data to a few hundred pertinent parameters
	(according to a communication by Jean-Claude Risset at the conference
	on Musique et Ordinateur, Universite Paris-Orsay, 1983). The question
	is then, which parameters are pertinent and for what purpose? A Concept
	is the result of an intellectual act that consists in defining abstractly
	something that may exist in reality. Let us assume that a work of
	art cannot be realized without a more or less elaborated Concept.
	Realization is commonly associated with professional skill. We should
	consider "realization" independently of the narrow standards established
	by music schools. Thus Realization is the act (accurate, professional,
	or not) of transforming a Concept into a communicable form. Models
	are elements or structures that exist in our environment or in our
	past; not the real objects as they exist(ed), but their image made
	by composers for their personal use, dimming some details that they
	consider as being of minor importance, emphasizing other ones. Figure
	1 lists some examples of Models. The Concept is the abstract representation
	(willfully conceived or unconsciously springing into thought, held
	in mental memory or developed on paper or other media) of what the
	Realization is going to be. Its elaboration, from the chosen Models
	aiming at the Realization, is the core of composing activity. Collegues
	who do not use computers for making music almost certainly would
	prefer the more poetic expression "vision" for this stage of composition.
	There are three aspects of a Concept: A. Concept of a working process:1.
	Free improvisation2. Organization according to the chosen means for
	realizing a sound event B. Concept of a musical form (see below)
	C. Both A + B The Concept of a musical form could be (in reference
	to the Model): A chosen Model Negation of a chosen Model Emphasis
	of one chosen Model over another Contradiction or distortion of a
	chosen Model Combination of several chosen Models (in relationship
	to the Realization): Time constraints (such as performance date and
	time) Time limits (total duration and sections) Choice of instrument
	(acoustical, electronic, combination of both, others) Number and
	choice of performers (instrumentation) Parameters and their hierarchy
	Notation Choice of programming language Means of synchronization,
	if synchronization is wanted Organization of soundspace, if wanted
	etc. etc. The Realization is a transcription (one of several possible)
	of the Concept to a means of communication. It is the final result
	of the composing process and takes the form of a performable score,
	a live performance, a recording to be presented in public, a recording
	for private audition, or a new not yet experienced music activity.
	Chronologically, the Realization is not always the final stage in
	the evolution towards a music event. In many cases, especially if
	the Realization is communicated via a score, a performance, including
	the required rehearsals, adds other problems to the music making.
	But we can consider the ensemble of such problems as being part of
	one of the previous stages. In fact, they might be part of a Model,
	and necessarily they have to be taken into account in the definition
	of the Concept and in the Realization. Appreciation of a Composition
	It is obvious that the selection of Models cannot be referred to
	in judging the quality of the realized composition. It might influence
	the degree of interest of the listener. Indeed it is hard to imagine
	how a composition based on an uninteresting Model could captivate
	an audiance, even if the Concept is clear and the Realization perfect.
	On the other hand, no matter how tempting the chosen Model, a sloppy
	elaboration of the Concept or the lack of accuracy in the Realization
	can only lead to a mediocre result. In many writings about music,
	even by some reputedly serious critics or historians, one encounters
	often the terms "inspiration" and "influence", the first implying
	a positive appreciation, the second a rather negative one. This terminology
	refers to the choice of Models, but does not inform the reader about
	the most important criterion, how the Concept has been elaborated.
	In other words, it does not say anything about the composition. Figure
	1. Examples of Composition Models Models in nature: Shapes of trees,
	leaves, flowers Crystals Nervous systems and neurons Coastlines Natural
	laws reveled by physics, chemistry, and biology Topography (maps
	of urban or natural sites) Solar systems, comets, constellations

	production and last but not least: Music Nil (absence of Models):
	Since tradition and innovation are synergetic in forming culture,
	it is hard to imagine a work of art that does not refer to an existing
	model. Yet for the sake of completeness I include this case in the
	scheme; one never knows what will be discovered in the future.},

	Dictionaries versus encyclopaedias ------- 
	
	"central assumption of cognitive semantics" (p. 206) should take an
	encyclopaedic view to meaning, not a dictionary view 'dictionary
	view' assumes: - a central core meaning(s) and other peripheral issues
	and sub-meanings (when it is unclear what criteria constitutes 'core'
	and non-core) 
	
	- words can be defined independently of context (whereas we wouldn't
	use words out of context but instead use them to refer to things
	we experience or consider, and need a frame of reference within which
	to understand the words) 
	
	- sense vs reference: do you use a word to refer to things and hence
	give it meaning, or does a word have an inbuilt meaning that determines
	how you use it? (I have to think it means the latter...!)
	
	major point here is that words can't be used out of context so don't
	have any relevance outside of context can't separate semantics and
	pragmatics word meaning is grounded in context and in our experiences
	
	encyclopaedic semantics supported by frame semantics (Fillmore) +
	domains (Langacker) (FS and domains form a basis for this work) basic
	domains are the basis for more complex abstract domains types of
	knowledge in encyclopaedic network (Langacker):
	
	- conventional (widely known), - generic (general rather than specific),
	- intrinsic (internal properties rather than anything external),
	- characteristic (unique to that thing being known about) - -- p.
	215 "While the dictionary view represents a model of the knowledge
	of linguistic meaning, the encyclopaedic view represents a model
	of the system of conceptual knowledge that underlies linguistic meaning."
	dictionary view C encyclopaedic view (is a subset of) 
	
	Enc. view characteristics (p. 215) " 
	
	1. There is no principled distinction between semantics and pragmatics.
	2. Encyclopaedic knowledge is structured. 3. There is a distinction
	between encyclopaedic meaning and contextual meaning. 4. Lexical
	items are points of access to encyclopaedic knowledge. 5. Encyclopaedic
	knowledge is dynamic. " 
	
	1. semantics (what words mean) == pragmatics (how words are used)
	(p. 216) "word meaning is a consequence of language use" as opposed
	to trad. view
	
	- "definitional meaning is the proper subset of semantic investigation
	while pragmatic meaning relies upon non-linguistic knowledge." p.
	216 2. structure - knowledge is organised into an encyclopaedic network.
	Some parts of knowledge contribute more to the meaning of a word
	(so are more _salient_ or _central_ ) 
	
	Types of knowledge in an enc. network(Langacker 1987): 
	
	1. CONVENTIONAL (widely shared) <--> NON-CONVENTIONAL (not shared
	amongst general population) 2. GENERIC (applies to many instances)
	<--> SPECIFIC (applies to few instances of that thing) 3. INTRINSIC
	(properties of thing that arise from its form) <--> EXTRINSIC (from
	external influence, external to the entity) 4. CHARACTERISTIC (unique
	to that thing) <--> NON-CHARACTERISTIC [more salient/central for
	word meaning] <--> [less important for word meaning] [1. - shared
	knowledge, 2., 3., 4.- individual knowledge] 
	
	3. encyclopaedic meaning != contextual/situated meaning encyclopaedic
	meaning arises from how the four types of knowledge interact and
	is informed by contextual meaning "meaning is fundamentally 'guided'
	by content" (p. 221) [NB remember CogLing is usage-based approach]
	context influenced by grammatical, situated, prosodic, informational
	and interpersonal factors 
	
	4. rather than "neat pre-packaged bundles of information" (p. 221),
	words are references to knowledge out-there. 
	
	5. meaning changes over time and is not static
	
	- -- SCHEMA = our stored mental representation of what a word means,
	abstracted from our recurrent exposure to that word.

	ideas of how we represent knowledge from psycholinguistics and neuroscience.

	and Brain Systems 22(577-609) Common system of representation (through
	mental states) for perception AND cognition('online' for perception
	and 'offline' for cognition.) "conceptual structure has a perceptual
	basis" (p241) proposal based on neuroscientific evidence, [presumably
	cited in Barsalou? not cited in this source] 
	
	Examples given by E\&G:- damaging parts of the brain responsible for
	perception of a certain thing/type of thing also damages ability
	to think/talk about that thing e.g. motor/somatosensory (touch),
	visual perception So conceptual knowledge (mental representations
	of) are perceptual symbols, as opposed to what is held by "Chomskyan
	mentalist model of language" which has influenced a common practice
	in considering mental representation as "non-perceptual" and "amodal"
	(based on abstractions rather than being situated) (p. 242)

	the head of writings of authors," the Court determined, "originality
	is required." 100 U. S., at 94. The Court explained that originality
	requires independent creation plus a modicum of creativity: "[W]hile

  title = {Essentially Contested Concepts},
  journal = {Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society},

  volume = {56},
  pages = {167-198},
  annote = {Creativity can be seen as an example of what Gallie described as
	\textit{essentially contested concepts} \cite{gallie56}: concepts
	which are subjective and whose meaning is commonly understood but
	elusive to define, with a variety of meanings attached to that concept.
	
	
	Essentially contested concepts usually cannot be measured directly
	and objectively, but can be used for qualitative judgement of worth;
	however their subjective and abstract nature makes it difficult for
	people to pin down these judgements in words in a way which is exact,
	complete and non-disputable. Gallie gives examples of (works of)
	art, democracy and social justice as essentially contested concepts.
	Though he does not mention creativity, it is not a great stretch
	of imagination to see how creativity could also be seen as an essentially
	contested concept. 
	
	The value of identifying creativity as an essentially contested concept
	comes in Gallie's discussions of how these abstract notions can be
	better understood through reflecting on this type of concept more
	generally, helping us override difficulties caused by disputes about
	a concept's exact meaning. 
	
	Gallie defines essentially contested concepts through several features,
	such as being internally complex in nature, but amenable to being
	broken down into identifiable constituent elements of varying relative
	importance, dependent on a number of factors such as context and
	individual preference. That this variety of interpretations exists
	is contributory to the coining of the descriptor of these concepts
	as 'essentially contested'; though there is consensus on the concepts'
	meaning in very general terms, exact interpretations differ. There
	is not a single agreed instantiation of these concepts but instead
	many reasonable possibilities. The influences of changing circumstances
	and contexts mean that essentially contested concepts, by their nature,
	will never be resolved to a single meaning or instantiation and their
	interpretation will continue to be contestable. },

	to be 'correct' (using an application for analysis of Spanish verse
	correctness [Gervas(2000) A Logic Programming Application for the

	3. comparing different combinations of initial data (using strategies
	that performed best in experiments 1. and 2.) - parameters for tests:
	data source [poetic or academic], extensions beyond the original
	text, types of word repetitions allowed, different types of pattern
	matching on text both before and after processing initial text, mixing
	sources for vocabulary and pattern provision. - Filtering stage:
	Three measures for each generated poem: no. of verses, value for
	syntactical correctness (1-5 Likert-type scale) and value for aesthetic
	rating (1-5 Likert-type scale: ugly, mediocre, acceptable, pleasing,
	very pretty)[are these translations from Spanish?] - these values
	assigned by authors, taking one pass through each poem, to filter
	out any poems which did not score at least 3 (3 verses) - 3 (``can
	be parsed as a weakly connected fragment of a sentence'') - 3 (acceptable
	aesthetically). Threshold standards chosen arbitrarily? 45 of 504
	poems selected through this filtering stage (6 from academic data
	source, 39 from poetry data source). - Evaluators (volunteers, not
	necessarily experts?) given the 45 poems, asked to select best 5
	in order of preference (best scored 5 points, second best scored
	4 points, etc). Totals added for each poem. EVALUATION FOR TYPICALITY
	AND AESTHETIC VALUE (fits in nicely with Ritchie's typ and val) Interesting
	footnote on p. 99 - the 1-5 values for aesthetic value of WASP's
	poems are treated by Gervas as the first 5 in a 1-10 scale for evaluating
	poetry written by people - Gervas had to make concessions for the
	poems being generated by a computer. How would the full 1-10 scale
	be labelled? perhaps: 1:ugly even for a commputer, 2:mediocre even
	for a computer, 3:acceptable for a computer, ... 6: better than a
	computer could do but ugly for a human, etc...? If some results are
	highly unpredictable by current standards but still have some aesthetic
	value, this is important and should be incorporated, though Gervas
	is lacking a way to quantitatively evaluate this (why should it be
	numeric? Because every other measurement is numeric? Does one of
	Ritchie's criteria provide this?) p. 100 ``Mixing data from two different
	pieces of text (patterns of one, vocabulary of the other) can have
	drastic negative effects if there is no match between the categories
	that apppear in the verse patterns and the categories represented
	in the vocabulary. However, it produces very interesting results
	from an aesthetic point of view. While no way has been found yet
	to evaluate this fact numerically, it has been observed informally
	by many of the evaluators and it should be taken into account for
	further analysis.'' Following on frm this (p. 100) ``In a matter
	where subjective opinion of the reader [sic], special effort must
	be made to devise an evaluation procedure athat provides a rigorous
	rating without interfering with the natural attitude of the evaluator
	as reader of a poem.'' In other words, if you want the opinions of
	human judges, be careful that your evaluation methodology does not
	alter, restrict or prejudice how the person interacts with what they
	are evaluating},

	in English. Following a brief review of several previous classificatory
	studies, the paper analyzes the orthographic and phonemic structure
	of blends on a quantitative basis. The main factors to be discussed
	are (i) the amount of information each source word contributes (following
	Kaunisto 2000a, 2000b) and (ii) the similarity of the source words
	to the blend. Several points of critique concerning previous analyses
	are raised and improved upon by introducing reliable ways of operationalization
	and statistical test- ing. The results show that the amount of material
	contributed by the words is determined by the degree of recognizability
	of the source words and that the similarity of source words to the
	blend plays a vital role in blend for- mation. The paper concludes
	by further validating these results on the basis of a comparison
	of intentional blends to speech-error blends and pointing out potentially

	= set of traits). "the psychologist's problem is that of creative
	personality" (p. 444) For the purpose of studying personality traits
	- Guilford isn't interested in the traits which are common across
	all people, but focuses instead on the ways in which people differ
	from each other. Therefore 'behavior traits' = how people behave
	differently from other people Categories of behaviour traits: - aptitude
	(for learning) - interests - attitudes - temperamental qualities
	(general emotional disposition) Definition of creative people: "A
	creative pattern is manifest in creative behavior, which includes
	such activities as inventing, designing, contriving, composing, and
	planning. People who exhibit these types of behavior to a marked
	degree are recognized as being creative." (p. 444) Outlines two main
	problems which he wishes to address: how to spot creative potential
	in people and how to develop people's creativity. Guilford describes
	a neglect of creativity in the literature (his influential address
	here probably had some impact in improving this): looking at the
	index of 'Psychological Abstracts' - 121000 titles listed in past
	23 years (1927-1950), 186 listed as definitely on creativity (listed
	under topics such as creativity, imagination, originality, thinking
	and tests in these areas). therefore less than 0.2 % [Psychological
	Abstracts was paper-based and withdrawn in 2006 after gradually being
	replaced by PsycInfo. Tried to replicate Guilford's results but didn't
	get a huge increase in % as expected. Repeating Guilford's search
	for 'creativity', 'imagination' or 'originality' as keywords, papers
	prior to 1960: 3815/223441 (1.7%) published works came up, 33692/2506237
	(1.3%) up to present day (February 2010) Under descriptor of Creativity*:
	14328/2506237 (0.6%) up to present day, or 299/223441 (0.1%) up to
	1960] Reasons for neglect: not recognised as a discipline in it's
	own right to be studied, difficulty of studying creativity (rarity
	of creativity if perceived as an act of genius), and of controlling
	the conditions for creativity. Creativity has wrongly been seen by
	some as just a part of intelligence (therefore covered by IQ testing
	etc). Guilford goes into detail later in the paper about why creativity
	is a different type of domain (divergent rather than convergent?
	should read this...) (This is up to page 445)},

  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  annote = {Hadamard is heavily influenced by \citeauthor{poincare29} and repeatedly
	draws from \citeauthor{poincare29}'s writings to illustrate his own
	experiences. 
	
	One area of particular influence is in the idea that a part of the
	creative process occurs below the level of the conscious mind. Hadamard
	refers to different levels of consciousness: - Full consciousness:
	the conscious mind - Fringe-consciousness or subconsciousness: what
	we are almost aware of, for example while speaking, our fringe-consciousness
	is aware of the next sentence we are about to say. - unconsciousness:
	that which our conscious mind is not aware of at all
	
	Hadamard also refers to \citeA{wallas26}. He describes the \emph{illumination}
	stage of the creative process as a mixture of chance and unconscious
	processing.
	
	`it is obvious that invention or discovery, be it in mathematics or
	anywhere else, takes place by combining ideas.'\cite[p. 29]{hadamard45}
	
	`invention is choice' (guided by `scientific beauty') \cite[p. 31]{hadamard45}
	
	(cf generate and evaluate cycle in creativity \cite{mcgraw93,pease10}
	e.g. engagement-reflection, Geneplore)
	
	interplay of logic and chance
	
	Our unconscious mind does the combinatory brute force work, our conscious
	mind perceives the most fruitful and chooses the most (a)esthetically
	pleasing one - which `feels' best. 
	
	As a Frenchman who, it is assumed, would have read the original French
	version of \citeA{poincare29} rather than a translation, Hadamard
	seems to be influenced by \citeauthor{poincare29}'s usage of the
	(ambiguous) word \emph{sensibilitie}, putting lots of emphasis on
	`feeling something is right'. This word refers to the sense of feeling
	or being aware of something as being significant, but has no direct
	translation in English beyond the lexical equivalent \emph{sensibility}
	which semantically does not have the same emphasis on feelings. 
	
	Lengthy discussion on how we don't need exactly the corresponding
	words in order to represent a concept (for example we can appreciate
	what \emph{sensibilitie} means). We can understand and use a concept
	without having a word for it. This is in contrast to the Sapir-Whorf
	hypothesis, although the two are not mutually exclusive. The Sapir-Whorf
	hypothesis doesn't require exact words for concepts as a match but
	does require that our native language can represent or refer to that
	concept in some way. For example we can understand different interpretations
	of the word `that' in the Hopi language after some study, but they
	are not immediately and intuitively obvious. 
	
	Hadamard stresses the importance of images rather than words, in thought.
	[incidentally, how would Hadamard argue blind people think?]},

  abstract = {The psychological study of creativity is essential to human progress.
	If strides are to be made in the sciences, humanities, and arts,
	we must arrive at a far more detailed understanding of the creative
	process, its antecedents, and its inhibitors. This review, encompassing
	most subspecialties in the study of creativity and focusing on twenty-first-century
	literature, reveals both a growing interest in creativity among psychologists
	and a growing fragmentation in the field. To be sure, research into
	the psychology of creativity has grown theoretically and methodologically
	sophisticated, and researchers have made important contributions
	from an ever-expanding variety of disciplines. But this expansion
	has not come without a price. Investigators in one subfield often
	seem unaware of advances in another. Deeper understanding requires
	more interdisciplinary research, based on a systems view of creativity
	that recognizes a variety of interrelated forces operating at multiple
	levels.},
  annote = {hennessey10
	
	Review of creativity literature (from a broad psychology perspective),
	taking into account different perspectives of creativity (mostly
	within the psychology literature, not taking into account computational
	creativity but looking at educational and cultural research), and
	using different levels of analysis: Definitions and Measurement,
	Neurological/Biological Basis, Affect, Cognition, and Training, Individual
	Differences/Personality, Groups and Teams, The Social Psychology
	of Creativity, Social Environment: Organizations, Schools and Culture.
	These are (in order) layers of a diagram of concentric circles, increasing
	in size: Neurological -> Affect/Cognition/Training -> Individual/Personality
	-> Groups -> Social Environment -> Culture/Society -> Systems Approach.
	
	Their end conclusions highlight the diversity and divided nature of
	creativity research and advocate a interdisciplinary `systems perspective'
	to creativity - how `creativity arises through a system of interrelated
	forces operating at multiple levels, often requiring interdisciplinary
	investigation.' [p. 571]
	
	---
	
	`Even if this mysterious phenomenon can be isolated, quantified, and
	dissected, why bother? Wouldn't it make more sense to revel in the
	mystery and wonder of it all?' [p. 570]
	
	Two answers offered by \citeauthor{hennessey10}: 1. to gain a better
	understanding of creativity, so that previous work by people such
	as PIcasso, da Vinci or Einstein (cited by the authors as examples
	of creative geniuses and `amazing individuals' [p. 570]) 2. to learn
	how to boost people's creativity. In a set of rather grandiose statements,
	creativity is hailed as some kind of miracle cure for society's woes:
	`it is only with creativity that we can hope to address the myriad
	problems facing our schools and medical facilities, our cities and
	towns, our economy, our nation, and the world. Creativity is one
	of the key factors that drive civilization forward. ... If we are
	to make real strides in boosting the creativity of scientists, mathematicians,
	artists, and all upon whom civilization depends, we must arrive at
	a far more detailed understanding of the creative process, its antecedents,
	and its inhibitors. The study of creativity must be seen as a basic
	necessity.'[p. 570] Obama's US presidency campaign (for Jan 2009)
	is described as calling for more funds to research education in both
	arts and science; this is used as a justification of why creativity
	should be researched (bearing in mind the previous statements).
	
	Definition of creativity as offered by Hennessey and Amabile: 
	
	`\textbf{Creativity:} the generation of products or ideas that are
	both novel and appropriate' [p. 570]
	
	\citeauthor{hennessey10} refer to creativity as a `distinctively human
	capacity' [p. 570], `one of the key factors that drive civilization
	forward.' [p. 570].
	
	As part of a review of literature, \citeauthor{hennessey10} asked
	selected prominent creativity researchers for up to 10 recommended
	key references, receiving `over' 110 suggestions from 21 researchers
	(5 did not respond) (5.3 novel suggestions for each researcher).
	
	\citeauthor{hennessey10} comment on the wide variety of references
	from this survey, with `so very little overlap in terms of material
	suggested.'[p. 571] (7 papers were suggested by 2 people, 1 paper
	suggested by 3 people, rest - over 100 - were only suggested by one
	person).
	
	This 'lack of consensus' [p. 571] is considered an indication of 'a
	growing fragmentation of the field': c.1950-1980: focus on creative
	personality and creative thinking 1980-1990: additional focus on
	social psychology of creativity (e.g. Amabile's 1983 work) 1990s-onwards:
	lots of different research directions, with very few central themes.
	
	[p. 571]`It is our firm impression that investigators in one subfield
	often seem entirely unaware of advances in another. This means that
	research is often only done at one level of analysis-say, the individual
	or the group-and within only one discipline at a time.' [though \citeauthor{hennessey10}
	then concede that there are some examples of cross-analysis and interdisciplinary
	work.
	
	Definition and Measurement analysis: 
	
	Difficulty in finding appopriate measurement standards/definitions
	- `Criteria for assessing persons or products may appear to be straightforward
	after decades of research. But appearances deceive. Debates surrounding
	definition and measurement continue to loom large. Although most

  abstract = {It's all in the mind... music, that is. A computer can't begin to
	make music without a human being... or can it? PAUL HODGSON explains
	the current way of thinking at the cutting edge of research into
	music cognition.
	
	
	
	You may have seen Courtney Pine playing with a jazz improvisation
	program on Tomorrow's World recently. The program played fluid jazz
	lines in the style of Charlie Parker, over a tune that was composed
	10 years after Parker died, and was described by Pine as 'bloody
	brilliant' and 'the best he had ever heard'.
	
	Does this mean, then, that computers will make musicians redundant?
	Will we, in future, press a button to instantaneously generate a
	new composition in a particular style and sit back and listen? Will
	we dispense with people and improvise with machines? Will machines
	be creative? Well, I would like to answer these questions because
	I wrote the jazz program and I would like to explain why.
	
	The main motivation for writing the program was a lifelong fascination
	with the way in which some musicians are able to improvise music
	without recourse to any notation. Before the development of written
	musical representation, music was learnt and assimilated by ear without
	any intermediate stage between hearing the music and playing it.
	Some musicians have a greater or lesser ability to do this, which
	raises the question of why this is so, and why some people have an
	incredible natural facility for improvising music which is way beyond
	that of normal ability. The main question for anyone interested in
	how the mind works is: how do they do it?
	
	If we are to understand how the mind works we have three options.
	We can cut brains up and do neuroscience, we can observe behaviour
	and do experimental psychology, and we can build models in computers,
	as I have tried to do. If a computer model does yield some understanding
	of how the mind works, we can then explore possible applications,
	to see if it can be employed in ways that will benefit musicians.
	Is it possible to use the model to hold different cognitive representations
	of musical structure according to the needs of the user, whether
	that be learning how to play an instrument or as an ideas generator
	for a new composition or for live performance?
	
	My program is based upon an approach to music cognition that assumes
	that melodic structure is learnt in chunks, rather than at the note
	level. In other words, the idea is that when we hear a melody we
	like, we segment the tune into selective chunks based upon our own
	personal preferences and experience. When we learn a new musical
	language such as Be-bop, we select phrases that we particularly like
	and reinforce the pathways to these phrases. The program is based
	upon the idea of preferential selection of specific chunks that are
	used in the construction of new phrases. The difficult part is the
	selection of the phrases and the way in which they are recombined
	to create new material. Brilliant musicians do this in a very organic
	way that unfolds into a beautifully balanced solo.
	
	Many people would argue that music is something that cannot be reduced
	to simple phrases, and they would most certainly be right. Charlie
	Parker believed that music could not be separated from life itself:
	"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If
	you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you
	there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line
	to art."
	
	We cannot model the complexity of human experience, however. Current
	thinking in Artificial Intelligence research is moving towards a
	view that suggests that intelligence can only be understood in terms
	of a complete organism in its environment. It is argued that the
	idea of abstracting out music from a person is far too reductionist
	and simplistic, in view of the overall complexity of a person's being
	in the world. What is needed, it is said, is a much more holistic
	approach that tries to understand the complex web of interaction
	between the person and their world. In fact, some people would go
	even further and argue that it's simply not possible to 'understand'
	the world; it's much better to meditate and just 'be' with the world.
	
	It is certainly true that a relatively simple computer simulation
	has nothing like the complexity of a human being, let alone a genius
	musician. It has no imagination or consciousness, no spirituality,
	no feelings for itself or others -- and, more importantly, it has
	no ability to develop any of these attributes. It is merely a set
	of rules for acting on a set of data. What's more, it cannot modify
	itself of its own volition and adapt to a new environment. If we
	tried to program it to attempt to do this the program would be so
	complex that it would never respond in time. If we used a more biological
	approach to try to overcome some of these problems we would very
	quickly reach a complexity threshold above which even if we could
	produce a good model, we would not understand how it worked. My program
	does, however, capture something of the music of Charlie Parker.
	On some level, therefore, it can help us understand how the mind
	carries out musical improvisation.
	
	Beyond gaining theoretical insight into the workings of the human
	mind, though, does a computer model of human musical creativity have
	any other uses? Does the possibility of such a model in a computer
	offer anything to people interested in the use and development of
	technology for making music?
	
	Given that musicians have always been limited/enabled by the current
	level of technology, be it simple drums, nose flutes or virtual synthesizers,
	it means that the model can be used to generate new material that
	might not have been thought of, in ways that might not have been
	considered. Future multimedia will increasingly develop cognitive
	representations that allow the user to take advantage of variable
	levels of cognitive ability that the program can develop in conjunction
	with the user. This does not mean a push-button world where a 'creative
	machine' will do everything and we become progressively more obsolete.
	It means using technology as a high-level interface into exploring
	and developing new ways of learning and creating. },

	UK or the European Economic Area (EEA). For example, a design would
	not be considered new if it had been 'published' on the Internet

	Components of Word Meaning - 3.4 A Test Case: Concepts of Ownership
	- 3.5 Conclusions Introduction ----------------- This chapter was
	originally a plenary speech for Jean Piaget society meeting in June
	1991. - Piaget -> conceptual learning - Chomsky -> syntactical learning
	Both -> complex mental processes at a subconscious level, abstractions
	of real world structure to mental constructs, anti-behaviourism.
	Jackendoff looks at concept learning then sees how Chomsky/Piaget
	differ. [I'm only really interested in his thoughts on word meaning
	though] 3.1 The Repertoire of Concepts ----------------------------------------------
	Cognitive theories for how we conceive of word meaning are mostly
	as "states of a combinatorial system" (p. 54) In these theories,
	the things being combined in such systems are symbols (or sometimes
	neurons). Conceptual structure = common ground between: concrete/perceptual/motor
	and abstract/mental Conceptual Well-formedness Rules: characterise
	the space of _possible_ conceptual states These rules determine the
	combinatorial space of possible well-formed CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURES
	which in turn have subsets which link to linguistic structures, subsets
	that link to perception and action and subsets that link to inference
	rules. (some of these subsets may overlap). Conceptual structures
	are the internal form that meanings take when parsing linguistic
	structures. Perceptual experience can be encoded linguistically using
	conceptual structures. Inference rules guide navigation from one
	concept to another (c.f. logical inference rules e.g. if X then Y,
	and we know X, therefore we know Y). Linguistic structures are the
	possible language expressions. Conceptual Well-formedness Rules |v
	linguistic <-> conceptual structures <-> perception and action structures|^
	v| inference rules where <-> = correspondence rules and -> = relations
	between entities (how one entity constrains another) "I am interested
	in the properties of the combinatorial space available to the brain
	- what possibilities exist, and what concepts are related to what
	other concepts in what dimensions." (p. 54) [rather than looking
	at exactly how neurons instantiate concepts in the brain, to which
	RJ thinks "we [don't] have any useful understanding of this issue
	at the moment" (p.54) 3.2 How words mean -------------------------------
	"a word meaning is a fragment of conceptual structure that is linked
	in long-term memory with a phonological structure (its pronunciation)
	and a syntactic structure (its part of speech and other syntactic
	properties such as grammatical gender and case-marking properties).
	That is, the words one knows consist of stored concepts linked with
	stored elements of linguistic expression." (p. 55) Our mental representation
	of a word once we have learnt a word (in long-term memory): Word
	= ( Syntax ( Fragment of conceptual structure ( Pronunciation No
	matter whatever a linguistic theory says must form part of a word
	meaning, the conceptual well-formed rules must make that possible
	(e.g. stereotypes, exemplars, lexical extensions etc) Word meanings:
	factors: 1. connecting the word's concept to perception/action (mental
	representions of perception/action) 2. interaction between inference
	rules and interpretation of word meaning e.g. difference between
	approach and reach (i.e. have you got to the target yet? incomplete
	vs complete actions) 3. taxonomic relations between the word and
	others - concepts ordered in a hierarchy e.g. animal > dog > poodle
	4. meaning given to the word by the grammatical way it is used e.g.
	I load a truck with furniture (completive) vs I am loading a truck
	with furniture (not [necessarily] completive) - well-formedness rules,
	inference rules, grammatical patterns, "non-linguistic modalities",
	relation between the word and related words - all have effects on
	what a word means and how it is used to convey meaning 3.3 Learned
	and Innate concepts ------------------------------------------------
	What do we need to learn for word meanings and what is innate? How
	does a child learn a new word meaning? RJ argues that the Conceptual
	Well-Formedness Rules have to be innate and completely cover the
	set of all possible conceptual structures. CWFRules seen as atomic
	propositions/axioms that completely define the space of all possible
	word meanings, which RJ says must be innate and cannot be learned/added
	to. "So the real issue has to be not, Is the space of possible concepts
	constrained by a set of innate principles? because everyone turns
	out to believe that it is. Rather, the issue is, How specific and
	detailed is the set of innate principles, and what are the specifics
	and details?" (p. 58) "word meanings are composite - that they are
	built up from some set of conceptual primitives and principles of
	combination. (p. 59) On this view, then, learning a word meaning
	is to be viewed as constructing a structured combination out of the
	primitives and principles of combination available in the Conceptual
	Well-Formedness Rules." (pp.58-59) Jackendoff offers recursive proof
	(inductive? deductive?) of innate principles existing - if word meanings
	are composites then at the basis of the compositional process there
	must be some starting point (or points) from which all higher-level
	composites are formed? So an axiom of space of concepts has to be
	a primitive (i.e. can't be broken down to any more fundamental a
	level). And it has to be innate beecause you learn from combining
	what you already have. [No other way of learning? e.g. transformation?
	(linking back to creativity) Jackendoff is saying that all word meanings
	are predetermined and innate, or derived from innate principles.]
	RJ then goes on to question what set of primitives could plausibly
	be a complete set to parameterise all possible concepts that we would
	need, whilst being tractable for young children to learn. Piaget
	suggests that the basic concepts are sensorimotor and build up from
	there, but RJ argues against this with a test case looking at the
	concept of ownership. "I believe that Piaget ... [has] not examined
	the process of extension quite closely enough ... I will argue that
	... an extension of spatial concepts to this new domain cannot take
	place unless some aspects of the domain are already made available
	by the primitives of conceptual structure, that is, unless they are
	innate." (p.60) [I don't think RJ actually answers the question he
	poses earlier about what size the set of primitives should be?] Relevant
	to creativity, in particular novelty: "If what is innate is a set
	of Conceptual Well-Formedness Rules, that is, a set of primitives
	and principles of combination, then this set provides an infinite
	number of possible concepts, only some finite number of which is
	attained by any particular human being. This means that *MY EMPHASIS*
	WITHIN THE SYSTEM ** there are always new concepts to be constructed
	that no one (p. 60) has had before. That is, there can be a great
	amount of novelty in concepts, even if there is none in the potential
	expressive power of the system." (p. 59-60) So all possible conceivable
	creations are predetermined by CWFRules - going against Maggie Boden's
	description of creativity (in 'What is Creativity' 1991) that is
	linked to making new concepts possible when once they weren't. This
	idea of finding undiscovered combinations, as opposed to new concepts,
	fits in with Nick's comments that incremental jumps in creativity
	are more easily received than huge conceptual leaps - because the
	undiscovered combination, once uncovered, opens the doors to new
	potential that could not have been accessed as easily before that
	combination was discovered? 3.4 A Test Case: Concepts of Ownership
	skipped for now - too much detail for a side point for me 3.5 Conclusions
	----------------------- Creativity to Jackendoff (from what I can
	tell of this) = unlocking previously undiscovered concepts (by combining
	existing knowledge in such a way that the combination facilitates
	this and future discoveries) "one should think in terms of a new
	domain being, if you like, "discovered"-that is, a previously unsalient
	or unnoticed possible germ concept is evoked and instantiated in
	the system of actual concepts, then the existing abstract orgainizing
	system is applied to it to construct the entire conceptual learning
	domain." (p. 67) and "if we think of conceptual structure as constructed
	from an innate combinatorial system, a great deal of novelty is indeed
	possible, since the system provides an infinite number of possibilities,
	only som small fragment of which are actually realized by any single
	human being." (p.67) To summarise the paper contents: "the issue
	ought not to be, How can we account for learning without falling
	back on innateness? but rather the less prejudiced question, How
	can we account for learning at all, and how much of it relies on
	an innate basis?" (p.67)},

	Q. Is human creativity ``clearly autonomous''? Perhaps a less troublesome
	way of expressing this is that we want computational creators to
	operate with a similar degree of autonomy to human creators. Autonomy
	is a contributing factor to human creativity, but needs to be accompanied
	by proactiveness, a purposeful intent behind actions: ``The description
	of creative autonomy offered here captures only a small part of why
	humans can be considered creative. A system whose creations had a
	style that was not easily traced to a few influences, yet was recognizably
	in same domiain, would be a major accomplishment. However, ... freedom
	from manipulation is not the same as acting purposefully'' \cite[p.
	9]{jennings08} Relevant comment on the simulations of creator/critic
	societies (regarding single critics vs multiple interacting critics):
	``In a single critic society, it is unlikely that the system's standards
	would be more than distorted agglomerations of the critic's standards.
	What's more, the ease with which the critic could manipulate the
	system would make it hard to argue that the creator was changing
	autonomously. In a multiple-critic society, complex interactions
	might make any one creator impervious to manipulation, and emergent
	dynamics of the system could lead to clusters of creative styles.
	This awaits empirical demonstration, which would still leave open
	the philosophical question of whether changing absent direct manipulation
	is the same as autonomy.'' \cite[p. 9]{jennings08} The eternal problem

	must always fight the impression that it is simply a fancy tool for
	expressing the programmer's creativity.''\cite[p. 9]{jennings08}

	defined, and too much driven from a bottom-up operationalist view.
	It is also argued that current popular definitions of creativity,
	by focusing on novelty and appropriateness, do not distinguish the
	concept of creativity in a satisfactory way from standard definitions
	of the concept of intelligence, which also focus on novelty and appropriateness
	as key defining features. A solution to this conceptual dilemma is
	offered by way of making a clear-cut distinction between novelty
	on the stimulus and novelty on the response side. This distinction
	is used as a platform for the development of a new taxonomy of different
	kinds of creativity and intelligent behaviour. A major feature of
	this new model is the distinction made between proactive and reactive
	creativity. Finally, the conceptual model is used as a basis for
	pointing out some shortcomings of existing tests of creativity and,
	with a practical-educational perspective in mind, some specific suggestions
	on the anatomy of a new kind of creativity assessment are made.},

	of grading Faulkner (or Mozart or Picasso) sounds absurd. The idea
	of ``grading'' Einstein or Bill Gates is a little absurd, too, yet
	we still have an awful lot of science and math questions on the SATs,
	GREs, AP tests and so on that could theoretically provide a reasonable
	grade for them. Indeed, most of the things that scientists try to
	measure don't merit this type of reaction.' \cite[p. 2]{kaufman09}

	No standard definition, which causes problems for measurement. `However

	- it is all likely different from how your neighbor thinks of it.
	There are many different ways in which someone can be creative, and

  address = {London, UK},
  annote = {As the only paper I have found which incorporates some form of learning
	how to segregate voices by training on examples, rather than by following
	rules, this is the most similar to my work. However the authors only
	train their system on very small amounts of data; they use one piece
	(Bach's Ciaccona) for both training and testing, choosing small sections
	(circa 4-8 bars) from this piece to train the system on. The training
	sections are selected due to their similarity to the testing sections
	chosen from the piece. In the later experimentation there is some
	effort to combine the earlier training sections into one large training
	section. However this is still only using a relatively small amount
	of training music and still uses the same piece, so therefore there
	is a constant underlying tonality, style, set of basic thematic ideas).
	Some overfitting may well occur to that one specific piece (Ciaccona).
	How would this generalise to other similar works by Bach? or other
	Baroque pieces? or more widely across the musical spectrum? Could
	their system cope with larger amounts of training data and if so,
	why haven't they used more? It is good to see in this paper that
	they say that they have found no other voice segregation methods
	that used automatic learning techniques - neither have I (yet) This
	method learns how to identify what voice a note belongs to by observing
	its pitch relationship with the note in the previous time-slot. They
	examine the piece in smaller windows rather than in one large set,
	using a fixed window size (the exact window size is varied across
	experimentation to see which gives the best results). Also: this
	system uses decision trees, therefore it is always a single, discrete
	answer that is given to the question "does this note belong to voice
	v?". No measure of the likelihood of this answer being correct, even
	in a non-probabilistic, general estimate. What happens in this system
	if there is a clash of two simultaneous notes being assigned to the
	same (monophonic) voice. The authors are unclear on this prospect.
	Thinking about Cambouropoulos's points (Voice identification 2006),
	it is interesting to see that this system makes no use of "vertical"
	information in its process (harmonic structure at any particular
	time-point c.f. Schenkerian analysis middle ground analysis level).
	So they do not make use of observations about what notes are sounding
	at the same time to guide their working at all. Another difference
	between this system and mine is in the end-goal of the system. My
	focus is on identifying the route that each voice takes throughout
	the entire course of the piece, assuming that voices are present
	(but not necessarily active) for the entirety of the music. K+U ,
	on the other hand, take a lower-level approach, identifying fragments
	of the voices on selected bars, but allowing the voices to vary throughout
	the course of the piece. },

	The tool design strategies were formed by analyzing the related previous

	and the specifications were verified by the subject matter experts.
	The multimedia contents and the teaching materials were also developed
	and integrated into the tool. The tool was verified again then implemented.
	The web-based support tool was used in three CPS fifth grade classes
	for a semester at an elementary school located in Seoul, Korea. By
	analyzing the data collected from the teacher and student surveys,
	observations, and focus group interviews, the tool was found to be

  annote = {`Creative Problem Solving is a model to solve problems in the problematic
	circumstances by the repetitive use of divergent and convergent thinking
	(Lee \& Lee, 2007). The balance between these two kinds of thinking
	in every step of the problem solving process is a critical factor
	for the CPS.
	
	CPS has emerged through the past several decades of work. The descriptions
	Osborn (1963) proposed have become the fundamentals of CPS. Parnes
	(1977) developed Osborn-Parnes model with five stages by revising
	Osborn`s initial framework. Isaksen and Treffinger (1985) added the
	sixth stage to Osborn- Parnes model. Through the studies in the 1980s
	and 1990s, the process and structure of CPS have been developed in
	details. The referred CPS modelsOsborn-Parnes` model (Parnes, 1977),
	Isaksen \& Treffinger`s model (Isaksen \& Treffinger, 1985; Treffinger
	et al., 2000), and Puccio, Murdock \& Mance`s model (Puccio et al.,
	2005). Among these models, Isaksen and Treffinger`s model and Treffinger
	and his colleagues` model are the most frequently referred conceptual
	models. Treffinger and his colleagues (2000) suggested a CPS model
	with four components, which can be classified into two major categories:
	a management component and a process component. The management component
	consists of 'Planning Your Approach', containing two stages of 'Appraising
	Tasks' and 'Designing Process'. This management component serves
	as an operating system to guide the application of the three process
	components, 'Understanding the Challenge', 'Generating Ideas', and
	'Preparing for Action'. These process components are composed of
	six specific stages, during which creative and critical thinking
	abilities are used in harmony. The followings are those six stages:
	'Constructing Opportunities', 'Exploring Data', 'Framing Problems',
	'Generating Ideas', 'Developing Solutions', and 'Building Acceptance'
	(Treffinger et al., 2000).
	
	The most outstanding characteristic of CPS is the repetitive use of
	divergent and convergent thinking (Puccio et al, 2005). Divergent
	thinking facilitates generating various creative solutions in the
	process of CPS (Lee \& Lee, 2007). Convergent thinking is a skill
	to determine the solutions by focusing on many possible ideas deliberately,
	and evaluating them (Kim, 2008). Therefore, for the successful application
	of CPS, it is critical to use both thinking skills appropriately
	and flexibly (Firertien, 1982). There are many techniques within
	the stages of CPS to enhance the divergent and convergent thinking
	skills (Kim, 2008; Lee \& Lee, 2007). Kim (2008) classified various
	thinking tools into the divergent and convergent thinking tools.
	For instance, brainstorming, forced connection method, morphological
	analysis, Osborn`s checklist, attribute listing, and SCAMPER are
	classified as the divergent thinking tools. On the other hand, the
	convergent thinking tools include hits, highlighting, reverse brainstorming,
	evaluation matrix, paired comparison analysis, ALU (Advantage, Limitation,
	and Unique Qualities), and PMI (Plus, Minus, and Interesting).'\cite[pp.

	and characteristics; and an evaluator, which, based on the output
	of the feature extractor, classifies the artwork according to a certain
	criteria. The validation methodology comprises several stages, ranging
	from author and style discrimination to the integration of the artificial
	art critic in a dynamic multi-agent environment, which includes human
	agents. Finally, we present experimental results obtained by the

  annote = {Artificial Art Critic (AAC) - framework for development: 
	
	 1. architecture - feature extraction [perception (convert into internal
	representation) and analysis (extract key features from int. repn)]
	---------> evaluator 2. validation - author and style discrimination,
	static subjective evaluation, integrating the critic into a multi-agent
	society.
	
	\citeauthor{machado03} note and address directly the problem of evaluation
	of AACs: `One of the main difficulties in the development of Computational
	Artists, and more specifically AACs, is their validation. To help
	address this problem we propose a multi-stage validation methodology.
	The first stage of this methodology allows the objective, and meaningful,
	assessment of the AACs, providing a solid basis for their development.
	The later stages incorporate more dynamic criteria, and include testing
	the AACs in a hybrid society of humans and artificial agents.' [p.
	55]
	
	AAC - not just art but also musical domain considered. 
	
	``feature extractor'' module [perception then analysis] - `In some
	cases the division between perception and analysis is more conceptual
	than real. The main idea is that the perception acquires information
	about domain-specific parameters, which are then analyzed.' [p. 58]
	
	The ``evaluator'' module takes the features identified by the feature
	extractor and uses them to assess the work. 
	
	Division between feature identification and feature assessment. This
	separation allows different types of feature extractors to be implemented
	and also different types of evaluators.
	
	[Could I incorporate this architecture into my agent-based simulation?
	Is there any gain in doing this? (apart from showing I'm aware of
	the literature, and to take advantage of other people's thinking
	on this area?) Perhaps the ability to show a clean separation between
	feature identification and evaluation is a motivator here] Something
	which diverges from my simulation `The adaptive {\em evaluator} should
	adjust its behavior, according to the received feedback, in order
	... to maximise its performance.' [p. 58] This is incorporated in
	the dynamic evaluation level of validation [But the paper says that
	not all levels of validation are always necessary (without qualifying
	exactly when or how this is the case)]
	
	Validation Methodology - multi-stage. Not quite sure how the evaluator
	(in the architecture) and the validation methodology are distinct
	- validation as evaluation of the evaluator?
	
	identify correctness of output (objectively) (static and fixed) ->
	`tasks of higher subjectivity and complexity' (dynamic and adaptive
	to the environment it operates in) [but is output correctness always
	static? I don't think so. An 'incorrect' output at one time may become
	correct as the environment evolves over time, it may become acceptable
	- e.g. would Schoenberg be considered 'correct' in Mozart's time?]
	
	Three levels of validation (last is dynamic, others are static): Identification
	(author and/or style) -> Static Evaluation -> Dynamic Evaluation
	
	Identification - using features to identify signatures of authors/style
	and/or corpus-based learning of style
	
	Static Evaluation - again corpus based, to determine aesthetic qualities
	(supervised learning from human assessments of aesthetics) [The question
	arises again about whether this is static or if human aesthetic preferences

	measured, rather than exploring how well the more subjective aspects

	Agents' societal interaction may follow `Zipf's principle of least

	levels of correctness assigned to each voice allocation, rather than
	a definite discrete classification. This would be useful in reconciling
	cases where there is a clash in assigning simultaneous notes to the

	is based on predetermined rules inspired by Temperley's preference
	rules for voice-leading harmonic structure. These rules are an example
	of how the implementors add human knowledge into the system for it
	to work correctly. Madsen and Widmer have experimented manually with
	the setting of this cost function, using their musical knowledge
	and observations of the performance of the system to improve voice
	identification success. Although some human-driven bias is inevitable

	the influence of human knowledge to a minimum. Instead it should
	learn as much as possible about how to construct the individual voices

	to guide it and later correct it. Madsen and Widmer's method is to
	heavily segment the voices so that small patterns of notes (c.f.
	Chew and Wu's contigs) are detected. They make a small post-processing
	effort to join these voice segments together but in general their
	main focus is on local voicings of notes rather than identifying
	a global voice that is present throughout the piece. They only test
	on Bach fugues. I would like to see how their work generalises to
	other voice-driven music such as quartets or orchestral works. },

	Psychology studies on motivation, collaboration, and divergent versus

	These insights intersect at an issue vital to the forefront of creative

	due to the need for multidiscipinary expertise and substantial resources
	to push the envelope of human knowledge. From partnerships across
	private, government, and universtity research sectors to open and
	collaborative peer production, large-scale collaboration is revolutionizing
	fields as diverse as software, film, music, and biotechnology. The
	psychology of creativity provides valuable lessons on how to advance
	these efforts.},
  annote = {\begin{quote} `Despite the value of facilitating creativity for intellectual
	property law, understanding creativity is hardly something within
	the competent domain of law and legal analysis. Not surprisingly,
	the legislative and judicial development of intellectual property
	law has paid remarkably little attention to what is known about how
	to promote creativity.' \cite[p. *** CHECK ***]{mandel11} \end{quote}
	
	Looking at intellectual property (IP) law in the context of psychological
	research into creativity,\citeauthor{mandel11} argues that intellectual
	property law treats copyrightable work as primarily the work of an
	individual, needing adaptation to adequately accomodate collaborational
	work. 
	
	\citeauthor{mandel11} also questions the role of intellectual property
	law as a motivational factor for creativity. Describing intellectual
	property as `the primary area through which the law seeks to motivate
	and regulate human creativity' \cite[p. *** CHECK ****]{mandel11},
	\citeauthor{mandel11} notes that IP law is an extrinsic rather than
	intrinsic motivational factor, in other words it provides an external
	reward for the results of the creative process rather than being
	an internal motivational process arising from within the creative
	individual. This results-driven motivational reward is less effective
	as a motivator for creative productive work than if an individual
	is inherently motivated to be creative \cite{amabile96}, unless it
	can be internalised in some way. 
	
	One example of such internalisation is in the {\em Rock the House}
	Intellectual Property project \cite{rockthehouse11} devised by Mike
	Weatherley MP. This project promotes awareness of music copyright
	laws via a band competition that is built around musicians' internal
	motivations to promote and publicise their music. Hence there is
	some intrinsic motivation for band musicians to assist towards the
	end goal of the project: to encourage musicians to copyright their
	creative work.

	Computational Creativity `While formulas might be thought up to assess
	the creativity of scientific or other useful systems, the need to
	assess more artistic creations presents a problem, because the nature
	of such judgements is inherently subjective. As long as this element
	of subjectivity remains, the development of the field will be incomplete.
	Worse yet, it will always be in danger of inconsistency.' \cite[p.
	1]{moffat06}
	
	Does this mean Moffat and Kelly are saying subjectivity is a bad thing?
	Can you remove the subjective element entirely from creativity evaluation?
	When modelling a dynamic context-grounded human phenomenon? Have
	to be able to capture evaluative context somehow - using subjective
	evaluation avoids the problem of simulating human reactions.
	
	On using experts to rate our creative systems: `we should also worry
	about the experts we ask to help us evaluate our creative systems
	and artefacts, because they might not be as helpful as we trust.
	They might even be deceptively useless, or worse. While we are at
	it, perhaps we should worry about our own attitudes.' \cite[p. 1]{moffat06}
	
	Moffat and Kelly took 3 human-generated and 3 computer-generated pieces,
	one of each type in free jazz (Voyager vs a free jazz ensemble improvisational
	piece), 'violin' music (Shostakovich symphony movement and an ILIAC
	string quartet) and Bach (piano concerto vs an EMI-Bach composition).
	
	Participants were asked, for each sample, how much they liked the
	sample and whether they thought it was composed by a human or a computer.
	After this stage they were told the origins of the piece (human or
	computer) and asked 'how much did you enjoy listening to it' (intended
	to be very similar to 'how much did you like the sample, but timed
	after they had found out whether the piece was human-generated or
	computer-generated. 
	
	Four research questions:
	
	Question Q1. Can people recognise computer music? - YES for non musicians,
	who identified computer music correctly 66\% of the time (20/30 computer-generated
	pieces correctly identified as computer-generated) but NO for musicians,
	who did no better than chance (15/30). - Surprising result on the
	part of the musicians!
	
	Question Q2. Do participants prefer the human-composed music? - YES.
	Ratings for liking the music were higher for human-composed music
	pieces than computer music (regardless of whether the participant
	realised it was human composed or not). - Some dodgy text in this
	explanation - Moffat and Kelly make the assumption (incorrectly)
	that if you like something, therefore you think it sounds authentic.
	But this doesn't interrupt the statistical testing that has been
	done, just discredits the explanation to some degree. - Musicians
	didn't show a greater preference for human-composed music - effect
	was about the same
	
	 - Question Q3. Are people prejudiced against computer music? YES
	but the statistical tests were not significant due to too small a
	sample size if you treat each genre of music individually, or confusing
	results if you group the genres together. [Would this have been so
	bad though?] - Doing some statistical analysis with the smaller sets:
	`In almost every case, a piece of music is preferred when it is thought
	to be human-composed.' \cite[p. 5]{moffat06}. So Moffat and Kelly
	`conclude that there is a ``free prejudice effect'' whereby people
	are prejudiced in favour of human music (which they freely themselves
	decide).' \cite[p. 5]{moffat06}
	
	 - Question Q4. Are people {\em overtly} prejudiced against computer
	music? This refers to an explicit prejudice, rather than an implicit
	one such as in the previous question - when people found out music
	was composed by a computer, did they react differently to it? Against
	the authors' expectations, they found no significant evidence for
	a change in 'liking' after finding out a piece of music was computer-composed.
	
	---
	
	Discussion
	
	Some discussion of a `Turing Test type of question' \cite[p. 5]{moffat06},
	referring to the common (mis-)interpretation of the turing test as
	participants given two things to judge and deciding which is human
	and which is artificial [explain why this is incorrect interpretation].
	Moffat and Kelly refer to their testing as `a close relative of the
	classic Turing Test' \cite[p. 5]{moffat06}.
	
	Surprisingly for the authors (and for this reader) musicians were
	less likely to detect artificial origins of a piece then non-musicians,
	although the numbers are very small (18/30 non-m vs 15/30 non-m).
	Neither group could consistently tell the difference [though this
	was not noted in the paper].
	
	`we did have clear evidence of bias or prejudice [but not where expected]
	... we found that musicians are more prejudiced against computer
	music than were the non-musicians.' \cite[p. 5]{moffat06} This prejudice
	is tacet though rather than conscious: `musicians significantly preferred
	the human-composed pieces. Can we not consider their aesthetic reaction
	to be an implicit kind of distinction between computer- and human-composed
	music?'\cite[p. 5]{moffat06} - so if musicians like one piece more
	than another, it is probable that the preferred piece is the human-composed
	one (if a choice of two)? Using the 'liking' values of 'indifferent
	to it', `dislike it' and `dislike it a lot' (as opposed to 'like
	it' and 'like it a lot') to identify a piece of music as computer
	rather than human-composed, this would have been 90\% accurate. This
	finding wasn't repeated for the non-musicians.
	
	Definition of `musician' in these tests was a little loose - to qualify
	as a musician the participant needed to either study music at school
	up till age 18, have had (at some point in their life?!?) received
	formal music lessons on any instrument (so a years worth of violin
	lesson aged 10 would qualify someone as a participant), or have been
	a member of a light operatic society for about 10 years. This last
	qualification seems somewhat arbitrary and I wonder if this only
	applied to one person or a small quantity of people who were for
	some reason needed to be qualified as musicians in the study. As
	the margins surrounding the study's main findings was only a handful
	of people each time, if slightly stricter qualifications had been
	applied to distinguish between musicians and non-musicians, then
	the study may have had totally different results after re-classification?
	
	
	---
	
	Conclusion: `the study seems to establish that people do have a tendency
	to discount and even dislike computer creativity'. \cite[p. 6]{moffat}.
	In detecting human or computer origins of a composed piece, musicians
	do this detection better if using unconscious aesthetic tendencies
	to like or dislike the music, rather than by directly using expert
	knowledge to make a decision on this (in fact experts are poor at
	consciously detecting that a piece of music is computer-composed).},

	We take one of these perspectives depending on our interest in creativity:
	product - interested in the end product of creativity as a benefit
	to us process - if a creative individual trying to understand their
	own creativity person - trying to select creative people e.g. for
	hiring environment - if wanting to cultivate a nurturing environment
	for creativity
	
	\citeauthor{mooney63} considers that rather than taking one approach
	and being blinkered to the other three through the influence of the
	favoured approach \cite<for example>{simonton88,ritchie07}, `The
	need is for a way of taking hold of all of these perspectives at
	once so that each can serve and support rather than threaten the
	others. ... it is necessary to come to a perspective which is large
	enough to encompass all four withn one system and deep enough to
	establish the interlocking function of all four.'\cite[p. 333]{mooney63}
	
	\citeauthor{mooney63} proposes a model which `puts together the four
	approaches by showing them to be aspects of one unifying idea'\cite[p.
	333]{mooney63}. Mooney feels that he has adopted all four approaches
	at various points of his career without feeling the need to separate
	the primary approach of that time from the other three approaches:
	`Not feeling split while still sensing the distinctions'\cite[p.
	334]{mooney63}
	
	This model seems to be of life itself, rather than specifically of
	creativity, and in actual fact may be rather too large to be practically
	useful for modelling creativity. To summarise and paraphrase, Mooney's
	model situates `man' in the `universe', `belonging to the whole'
	whilst `being integrative to the whole', with a `give-and-take, incoming
	and outgoing' relationship between man and `his universe', balancing
	the `fit' between `inclusion of the needed (plus), exclusion of the
	damaging (minus), and toleration of the remainder (equals)'. \cite<all
	quotes in this paragraph from>[p. 337]{mooney63}. Diagrammatic figures

	computational creativity, unpredictability being a quality that is
	often associated with creativity. Any creativity model that is assessed
	solely by comparison to an inspiring set may inadvertently overlook
	outputs that are considered creative when assessed independently

	[taken out of lit review] \citeauthor{odonoghue07} is dismissive
	of the approach in \citeA{ritchie01}, which is described as ``artefact-centric''
	due to its reliance on the existence of an inspiring set (a set of
	prior examples of artefacts in the system's domain that are programmed
	into the system and used during artefact generation). Whilst accepting
	\citeauthor{ritchie01}'s standpoint that it is important to assess
	products for novelty and validity, \citeauthor{odonoghue07} suggests
	that it is also important for systems to operate in a way that closely
	resembles human creative processes (a \emph{process-centric} approach
	to computational creativity). \citeauthor{odonoghue07} criticises
	\citeauthor{ritchie01} for focussing evaluation too strongly on comparison
	to an inspiring set : \begin{quote} ``Any creativity model that is
	assessed solely by comparison to an inspiring set may inadvertently
	overlook outputs that are considered creative when assessed independently
	of that inspiring set. True creativity can only be assessed <i>post-hoc</i>.''
	\cite[p. 32]{odonoghue07} \end{quote} This criticism of \citeA{ritchie01}
	is perhaps a little unjustified, as \citeauthor{ritchie01} combines
	criteria that use the notion of an inspiring set with criteria that
	do not consider the inspiring set. \citeA{odonoghue07} continually
	refers to a ``knowledge base'' that can be used during program construction
	and evaluation. The difference between this knowledge base and an
	inspiring set is left unsaid by \citeauthor{odonoghue07}; it is far
	from inconceivable to interpret the two concepts as being the same.
	Also, it is difficult to see how \citeauthor{odonoghue07}'s artefact
	assessment approach includes an evaluation of the cognitive plausibility
	of the system. Indeed if this paper's contribution is intended merely
	as a constituent part of such an evaluative process, then the omitted
	details have not yet been addressed in subsequent publications by

  annote = {INTRODUCTION 
	
	This is about how teachers perceive creativity in their students and
	how this perception is shaped over time by the teachers' own experiences.
	So it focusses on the assessor/developor rather than the creative
	person themselves, and how to set up an environment for fostering
	creativity, as well as how to assess creative productivity. Describes
	the progress of creativity research as booming in the 60s+70s, then
	after a period of relative quiet [really!? I disagree], it has peaked
	again in the last decade. Discusses Boden's P vs H creativity in
	different terminology Personal (Boden 1990) = new concept (Elliot
	1974) or little-c creativity (Craft 2001, Gardner 1993) Historical
	(Boden 1990) = traditional concept or big-c creativity Separates
	these two types of creativity out and focusses this investigation
	on the assessment of personal or new concept creativity, i.e. we
	shouldn't try to assess pupils' creativity on the basis of historical
	creativity, but on their own personal achievements as an individual.
	Creativity in the musical curriculum through composition and improvisation
	(weighted to different degrees partly by the curriculum requirements
	and partly by teachers' previous experiences and preferences). Also
	on a wider scale pupils' creativity in thinking should be fostered
	through their general education. So creativity in thinking vs creativity
	in composition/improvisation. 
	
	RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
	
	Questions for the project (p. 418): 
	
	"1. What are these schoolteachers' perceptions of creativity? 2. What
	are the similarities and differences between the literature on creativity
	and these teachers' perceptions? 3. In what ways do these teachers'
	musical and professional experiences influence their perceptions
	of creativity?" 
	
	This paper focusses on 1. and 3., answering question 3 in terms of
	a generative model on how perceptions of creativity develop. My interest
	also includes 2. Brief summary of 2. from a previous paper: literature
	on creativity and these results point to the PEPP framework (Pupil*,
	Environment, Process, Product) [*as in an educational context] -
	Personal attributes - Environment - Process - Product Four stages
	of project: 1. Define creativity, explore what it means 2. State
	methodological assumptions that have been made 3. Collect data (see
	methodology) 4. Analyse data 
	
	RECENT STUDIES ON THE COMPOSING AND IMPROVISING PROCESS 
	
	Several references on process of composition and improvisation. Describes
	in a little detail studies by Burnard (2005, 2000) where students
	were asked to record their processes and experiences during composition.
	Fautley (2004, 2005) used data on group composition teaching to suggest
	how this process could be modelled. MacDonald (2006) linked flow
	to university students' group composition. 
	
	RECENT ENQUIRIES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF MUSICAL PRODUCTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
	FOR CREATIVITY 
	
	Again this is a list of references rather than much summary detail.
	Strangely the assessment of products and inspection of environment
	have been [rather clumsily] lumped together as one (though I don't
	see why, particularly as Odena etc emphasise how each part of PEPP
	is important). Authors mention the "increasing researchers' interest
	in [the creative product and the environment for creativity]" (p.
	420) Environment: Barrett(2006) on the social support received by
	student; Berkley (2004) on what constitutes a positive learning environment.
	Assessment of products: MacDonald (2006) again on the link between
	students' description of their 'flow' and the quality of their compositions
	(as assessed by experts). The following links could be interesting
	to follow up, as they look at how you assess musical creativity (sometimes
	coughing this in other terminology like imagination, inventiveness
	or competence in composition: Kozbelt 2005/07, Priest 2006, Widmer
	2005. 
	
	RESEARCH ON CREATIVE STUDENTS AND OTHER STUDIES THAT COMPLEMENT THE
	FOUR-FOLD FRAMEWORK 
	
	The emphasis here is on creative STUDENTS and their characteristics.
	Again some useful looking references here in amongst the lists, e.g.
	Goncy and Awehler 2006 on the characteristics of creative students
	or modelling common aspects of creative environment, process and
	product in musical education by Folkestad 2004 (this may be worth
	a look in particular). Also philosophical reflections on what creativity
	means in this domain (Humphreys 2006) and discussion of how creativity
	develops from childhood to adolescence, in an individual and social
	context (Burnard 2006). Fryer and Collings 2001, Runco et al 1993,
	Torrance (1963, 1975), use quantitative methods to see how teachers
	perceive creativity, but these are more descriptive than analytical,
	according to the authors [or maybe they're just more scientific than
	Odena et al are used to, as opposed to the more humanities-style
	approach? Hard to say without having seen the papers]. 
	
	METHODOLOGY 
	
	6 teachers selected using 'maximum variation approach' (Lincoln and
	Guba 1985). Classrooms videotaped, teachers interviewed and shown
	video extracts from the taping (validated by the teachers as being
	representative). Teachers also had to complete a Musical Career Path
	questionnaire. THE 
	
	TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF CREATIVITY 
	
	Varied amongst teachers. All perceived creativity as p-creativity/little-c/new
	concept creativity: not everyday creativity but also not genius-only:
	a human ability which we all possess and can develop. They didn't
	agree on a universal definition of creativity though. 
	
	Categories for creativity: *PUPIL: Personal characteristics, Individual
	learning {Adaptor students vs innovator students}, Home background
	*ENVIRONMENT: Emotional environment {Motivation, School culture,
	Teachers' role, Teaching methods, Time requirements}, Physical environment
	{Complaints and proposals for improvement, Classroom settings} PROCESS:
	Different activities, Group processes, Improvisation-composition,
	Structured process, Unstructured process PRODUCT: Assessment, Originality,
	Music style and conventions 
	
	[How does this match up to my keywords for creativity from each category?]
	[*Where does 'pupil' stop and 'environment' start, in an embodied
	creative system (i.e. a pupil composing)?] [Also to what extent is
	process interacting with environment and product? All the components
	of PEPP co-exist and are mutually dependent on each other, they interact
	and influence each other - Odena etc don't mention this directly]
	
	 Findings match up to creativity theory to some extent (e.g. serialist
	(Entwhistle 1981/91)/adaptor(Brinkman 1999) pupils learning step
	by step [bottom up?], as opposed to holist/innovator pupils taking
	a wider perspective [top down]) Discussed elsewhere in more depth
	(2005 paper by these authors) but focussed on school culture and
	group dynamics as well as learning styles). Here the authors give
	a few examples of how the findings matched to theory in terms of
	time and other pressures [mostly seen as negative - but does pressure/adrenaline
	provoke creativity, perhaps of a different kind...?], the need for
	structure (or not) in the task being done, budget and resources and
	how the curriculum doesn't necessarily specify exactly what to teach
	(in fact the teachers could be creative here!) Authors mention 'the
	qualities good work' (p.426) and how this was negotiated or discussed
	with students, without going into detail on the assessment criteria
	or teachers' definition of good work - how can you judge how good
	something is unless you have something to measure it by? This is
	left as being implicit in the teachers' knowledge and partially derived
	by discussions with students. 
	
	THE INFLUENCE OF TEACHERS' MUSICAL AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES ON
	THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF CREATIVITY 
	
	This is looking at personal perceptions of creativity and what shapes
	the observers' viewpoints in the long term and over time. Teachers'
	experience is classified (through Musical Career Path questionnaire
	data) into: Musical, Teacher education and Professional teaching.
	Significance of each strand is similar to the amount of variety of
	experiences in that strand, for all participants. Influences on how
	the teachers view creative pupils and how they try to encourage creativity
	in their pupils. This is affected by their experience of different
	pupil backgrounds (not just for music but for life in general) and
	their stereotypical perceptions resulting from this experience. Also
	the more varied the teacher's background, in general, the more varied
	their teaching is, from these results [although they are really basing
	this on one counter example of Patrick - maybe he is just an anomalous
	example - it is difficult to introduce general conclusions based
	on one participant vs the rest.] As a result of viewing creativity
	as personal rather than historical, they all adapt their teaching
	to different pupils rather than apply a general set of rules. [Can't
	force creativity development to happen at a particular rate - same
	as intelligence to some extent.] How to deal with pupils' products
	that didn't fit the specified task structure/instructions but that
	exhibited creativity? Teachers' views of creativity are influenced
	by how open-minded they are and the breadth of experiences theyve
	had [also surely the strictness of the school and the curriculum?].
	
	
	DISCUSSION: TOWARDS A GENERATIVE MODEL OF THE TEACHERS' THINKING ON
	MUSICAL CREATIVITY 
	
	Constant interaction between musical expertise, education and teaching
	experiences: this all contributes towards shaping a teacher's perceptions
	of creativity both short and long term. These perceptions have a
	direct result on the future classroom teaching they do - hence a
	cycle between teachers' experiences, perceptions and classroom methods.
	Teachers develop (through teaching experience) their educational
	expertise and perceptions of creativity, and this feeds back into
	their teaching methods, in a cyclic manner. What is important for
	this cycle is feedback and reflection (formative and evaluative evaluation)
	on practice. Cain et al 2007: plan -> act -> observe -> reflect ->
	plan etc (this doesn't include adapting plans though so maybe there
	are mini-level(s) of plan -> act etc within act?). Adaptation is
	directly referred to here - the need to be creative in how you encourage
	creativity to develop in others. Some teachers adapted marking criteria
	as well. 
	
	CONCLUSION: EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATIONS AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER ENQUIRY
	
	
	You are better placed to judge the creativity of others if you know
	that domain and many others/or can adapt easily to new domains. Creativity
	in music education [and elsewhere!] is complex and can't be pinned
	down by teaching guidelines. Rest of this section is about how this
	reflects into educational practice. ---- Overall - nice introduction
	to PEPP and its interesting to look at the role of the evaluator
	in evaluation rather than just the role of the creative individual.
	Recognises that evaluators will vary as well and any standards in
	evaluation will have to adapt to this (if such standards exist).
	While this paper focusses on education so most of its findings aren't
	directly useful, it will be interesting to compare the findings of
	creativity in composition/improvisation teaching to findings about
	creativity in other domains. (esp categories for creativity - how
	can these be generalised?)},

	We discuss the implementation of the system and some of its most

	make the given configuration replicate. We found that this approach

	work quite differently than those of many past manually designed
	replicators: There is no identifiable instruction sequence or construction
	arm, the replicating structures generally translate and rotate as
	they reproduce, and they divide via a fissionlike process that involves
	highly parallel operations. This makes replication very fast, and
	one cannot identify which descendant is the parent and which is the
	child. The ability to automatically generate self-replicating structures
	in this fashion allowed us to examine the resulting replicators as
	their properties were systematically varied. Further, it proved possible
	to produce replicators that simultaneously deposited secondary structures
	while replicating, as in some past manually designed models. We conclude

  abstract = {Evan Parker will present an overview of the history of his life in
	improvised music, illustrated with recordings and covering the evolution
	from free jazz, to improvised music to computer-based electroacoustic
	developments. This will lead into a workshop on improvised music.
	
	Evan Parker (born in Bristol, 1944) took up the saxophone at the age
	of 15. Early influences included Paul Desmond, Eric Dolphy, and above
	all John Coltrane. After witnessing the Cecil Taylor Trio with Jimmy
	Lyons and Sunny Marray in full flood in New York in 1962 he was,
	as he says, ``marked for life'', converted to the intensities of
	free jazz. Back in England, he gradually found players to share his
	ferbour, including John Stevens and the members of the Spontaneous
	Music Ensemble - Dave Holland, Kenny Wheeler, Paul Rutherford, Derek
	Bailey and others - and, importantly, Peter Kowald, who made the
	introductions to the German scene. Parker played on Peter Br\:otzmann's
	still dangerous `Machine Gun' in '68 and, before the 60s had run
	their course, had also recorded with Manfred Schoof and Pierre Favre.
	In 1970 he joined the Alex von Slippenbach Trio, of which he is still
	a member, and subsequently the Globe Unity Orchestra. By this point
	the hallmarks of his unique style were established, his combinations
	of circular breathing, tonguing, rhythm patterns, overtones and polytones
	making his sound instantly recognisable. 
	
	Free improvised music has accounted for most of Parker's activities
	over the last forty years, whether playing solo or in groups, but
	both jazz and art music composers have also deployed the arresting
	physiciality of his sound as a contrasting and energising element.
	His saxophones have been heard inside jazz big bands led by Kenny
	Wheeler, Chris McGregor, Barry Guy, Stan Tracey and Charlie Watts
	and in the chamber music of Michael Nyman, Gavin Bryars, Frederic
	Rzewski and others.
	
	A major force in European improvising, Parker has collaborated, too,
	with American innovators, amongst them Cecil Taylor, Paul Bley, Anthony
	Braxton, Roscoe Mitchell, George Lewis and Wadada Leo Smith. He has
	also bene sought out by artists on the experimental fringe of pop
	music, and Scott Walker, Robert Wyatt, Annette Peacock, David Sylvian,
	Jah Wobble, Spring Heel Jack and Squarepusher have all called upon
	the sonorities that only Evan Parker's saxes can provide.
	
	Since 1990 Parker has led the Electro-Acoustic Ensemble whose radical
	cross-referencing of improvisation and real-time sound processing
	has brought fresh sound-colours into the music as well as new ways
	of working. Ensemble member Richard Barrett has spoken of the EAE
	providing a model for a new kind of improvising orchestra.
	
	Evan Parker appears on more than 200 recordings on labels including
	ECM, FMP, Emanem, Incus, Ogun, Po Torch, Okka, Island, CBS, RCA etc.
	In 2001 he founded his own label, Psi.

	improvisation? The two music-making activities overlap to some degree.
	
	Of improvisation: "The activity is its own reward"
	
	Recommends John Stevens' "search and reflect" book - a community approach
	to making music (also mentioned by Bennett Hogg)
	
	Also quotes from a book by Richard Merrick. 
	
	Asked `where do you think jazz is going?', Evan Parker replied `I
	think it's going towards computers, and interaction with computers.'
	
	Panel discussions centre around electronic/electroacoustic music improvisation.
	
	On George Lewis's Voyager (which Evan Parker has played with) - when
	things are going well (in Voyager's performances), he [Lewis] just
	starts the program running and doesn't touch it... until it crashes,
	which it often does!},

	Derive critic rules 3. Compose to these rules 4. Evaluate composition
	using human assessment [perhaps reorder these - swop 2 and 3? so
	that the composer is working to their own compositional aims rather
	than a critic's interpretation of those aims?] Interesting framework
	but traps the creator into rules early on. What if the composer transcends
	these rules (this could potentially be judged well during the evaluation
	experiments in stage 4) - is this scenario actually possible given
	this framework? Section 7: Evaluating Musical Creativity Pearce and
	Wiggins position their music composition evaluation framework as
	being concerned with exploratory creativity rather than transformational
	creativity, and concerned with P-creativity rather than H-creativity.
	``It might ... be objected that the really creative musical acts
	involve the founding of a new style or genre. However, as noted by
	Garnham (1994) most creative achievement in the arts does not follow
	this form: ``the origins of the symphony are lost in history and
	its major triumphs are the work of composers who did not invent the
	basic symphonic form.'' Most creative work is carried out within
	styles or genres.'' \cite[p. 10]{pearce01} PRODUCT AND PROCESS: emphasis
	in this paper is on product but process is also important - in Pearce
	and Wiggins' experiments, people's evaluation of music has shown
	that often people make assumptions about process in their judgements
	on product. Later Pearce and wiggins go on to say that our interpretation
	of how something was produced is important, even if the actual method
	isn't (e.g. Colton 08) and that such an interpretation can be derived
	if people are repeatedly exposed to the compositional systems (human
	or computational) that they are evaluating. ``It might be suggested
	that evaluation of machine compositions themselves can only tell
	us so much about the creativity of a compositional system: we would
	want to know about the internal workings of the system (its compositional
	processes) before we called it creative). '' Pearce and Wiggins on
	Boden 1990: ''As noted by Boden (1990) this [the internal workings
	of the system] appears to be an important criterion by which people
	are reluctant to attribute creativity to machines. Furthermore, Cohen
	(1999) refuses to attribute Aaron (his program for the generation
	of artworks) with creativity although it generates pieces it has
	never painted before and has a unique and characteristic style. This
	is largely because he doesn't believe it is creating the paintings
	in the right way.'' (p. 10) Quote taken from Pearce and Wiggins 01
	Hofstadter (1994) ``\emph{covert mechanisms} can be deeply probed
	and eventually revealed merely by means of watching \emph{overt behaviour}
	... lies at the very heart of modern science.'' This contrasts to
	Ritchie's claims that we can only evaluate based on product because
	that is the only empirical data available to us. Important for experiments
	(stage 4): 1. clear and stated evaluation criteria 2. repeatedness
	of experiments to deduce conclusions on a different perspective over
	a longer time scale. p. 11 ``The issue of evaluation is ... one that
	is frequently given less attention than it deserves in the literature
	on algorithmic composition.'' Later they highlight that the evaluation
	of musical creativity is ``worth of future work'', both by assessing
	the produced compositions and by how the assessors infer the underlying
	compositional processes over repeated exposure to a system's compositions.},

	a widespread failure to specify the motivations and goals involved
	has lead to a methodological malaise in music related research. A
	brief consideration of some of the earliest at- tempts to produce
	computational systems for the composition of music leads us to identify
	four activities involving the development of computer programs which
	compose music each of which is inspired by different practical or
	theoretical motivations. These activities are algorithmic composition,
	the design of compositional tools, the com- putational modelling
	of musical styles and the computational modelling of music cognition.
	We consider these four motivations in turn, illustrating the problems
	that have arisen from failing to distinguish between them. We propose
	a terminology that clearly differentiates the activities defined
	by the four motivations and present methodological suggestions for
	research in each domain. While it is clearly important for researchers
	to embrace developments in related disciplines, we argue that research
	in the four domains will continue to stagnate unless the motivations
	and aims of research projects are clearly stated and appropriate

  organization = {AISB},
  abstract = {Computational Creativity is the AI subfield in which we study how
	to build computational models of creative thought in science and
	in the arts. From an engineering perspective, it is desirable to
	have concrete measures for assessing the progress made from one version
	of a program to another, or for comparing and contrasting different
	software systems for the same creative task. 
	
	We describe the Turing Test and versions of it which have been used
	in order to measure progress in Computational Creativity. We show
	that the versions proposed thus far lack the important aspect of
	interaction, without which much of the power of the Turing Test is
	lost. 
	
	We argue that the Turing Test is largely inappropriate for the purposes
	of evaluation in Computational Creativity, since it attempts to homogenise
	creativity into a single (human) style, does not take into account
	the importance of background and contextual information for a creative
	act, encourages superficial, uninteresting advances in front-ends,
	and rewards creativity which adheres to a certain style over that
	which creates something which is genuinely novel. 
	
	We further argue that although there may be some place for Turing-style
	tests for Computational Creativity at some point in the future, it
	is currenty untenable to apply any defensible version of the Turing
	Test.
	
	As an alternative to Turing-style tests, we introduce two descriptive
	models for evaluating creative software, the FACE model which describes
	creative acts performed by software in terms of tuples of generative
	acts, and the IDEA model which describes how such creative acts can
	have an impact upon an ideal audience, given ideal information about
	background knowledge and the software development process. 
	
	While these models require further study and elaboration, we believe
	that they can be usefully applied to current systems as well as guiding
	further development of creative systems.},
  annote = {Distinguishes between whether an artefact is valuable or not, and
	whether a system is acting creatively or not, focussing on the latter.
	
	P\&C discuss how versions of the Turing test have been applied in:
	- discrimination tests (Pearce and Wiggins 2001, which they do not
	critique but just describe), - Boden's adoption for artistic creativity
	which fails as there is no interactive or discriminative element,
	- as a direct test of the common definition of compcreativity as
	tasks which if performed by humans would be considered creative
	
	Criticises Turing test for reasons listed in abstract - - different
	styles of creativity are not equally recognised - creativity is domain-specific
	to some extent - framing (contextual) information ignored - can be
	cheated by 'window dressing' etc, in ways aimed at passing tests
	- encourages pastiche (shallow imitations) at the expense of genuine
	creativity - it is too hard! (if systems are judged at the level
	of creativity of humans) 
	
	(also interaction issues - how do you talk to the computer and ask
	it to be creative?)
	
	Alternative suggested: FACE model to represent creative acts and IDEA
	model to evaluate the acts
	
	FACE model (Frame, Aesthetic, Concept, Expression of concept) - (each
	of F, A, C, E divided into e.g. $F^p$ - generation method, $F^g$
	the thing itself (or an item or measure of it)
	
	assumption of novelty for creative acts (only assumption - doesn't
	worry about distinguishing between exploratory/transformational,
	merely/fundamentally novel, etc) for inclusivity
	
	IDEA model - Iterative Development Execution Appreciation cycle assume
	ideal audience i and the effects that one creative act A has on i
	(change in well-being, wb, cognitive effort for appreciation,ce)
	(why is more or less cognitive effort a good or bad thing?)
	
	Propose several quantitative measures within this model, measuring
	disgust, divisiveness, indifference, popularity, provocation, acquired
	taste, instant appeal, opinion splitting, opinion forming, shock
	and subversion. 
	
	FACE and IDEA are proposed not as the be-all and end-all for evaluation
	but a `beginning in our efforts to avoid some of the pitalls of the
	TT' [p. 7]. Plans to develop sub-models of aspects of creativity
	(big long list - affect, analogy, appreciation, audience, autonomy,
	blending, community, context, curiosity, etc)
	
	End goal: a large detailed formalisation of computational creativity...
	`Using the foundational terminology for creative acts and impact
	described above, we plan to expand each term into a formalism containing
	conceptual definitions and concrete calculations using those definitions
	which can be used for the assessment of creativity in software. In
	doing so, we hope to contribute a {\em Computational Creativity Theory}
	which willprovide a strong foudnation for objectively measured progress
	in our field.'

	"We assume that creativity in children, adults and geniuses is essentially
	the same phenomenon." (p129) - creativity = generation + evaluation

	a linear judgement) we should ask 'where does <x> lie in a creativity

	this practically? (p137) "we must structure our research by developing

	It is currently more appropriate to ask 'is P1 or P2 more creative
	in aspect A?' (particularly if P1 and P2 are versions of the same

  volume = {11},

  number = {2},
  annote = {Plucker's essential argument for domain generality of creativity
	is based on attacking arguments for domain specificity of creativity,
	rather than offering concrete evidence for domain general creativity.
	
	Plucker motivates the debate on how domain context affects creativity:
	\begin{quote} `Determining whether creativity in one context is independent
	of creativity in other contexts has numerous implications for the
	study of creativity' \cite[p. 181]{plucker98} \end{quote}
	
	Acknowledging that there is evidence both for and against domain generality
	in creativity, Plucker explains this by citing differences in methods
	for detecting creativity:
	
	\begin{quote} `Performance assessments produce evidence of task specificity,
	and creativity checklists and other traditional assessments suggest
	that creativity is content general.' \cite[p. 180]{plucker98} \end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `creativity research would be more revealing if traditional
	assessments found evidence of specificity and performance assessments
	produced evidence of generality!' \cite[p. 181]{plucker98} \end{quote}
	
	[There is a difference between saying: (a) a level of general creativity
	exists which transcends domain boundaries and is common to all creative
	work and saying: (b) someone who is creative in one domain is (by
	default) creative in all domains because they have highly developed
	creativity skills.
	
	Statement (a) does not necessarily imply statement (b). Someone who
	is creative in a domain may not perform creatively in another domain,
	but this should not be seen as proof that creativity is domain specific.
	Instead, this difference in creativity may be down to variances in
	what \citeA{amabile96} terms \emph{Domain-Relevant Skills} (skills
	and knowledge specific to a given domain) and \emph{Task Motivation}
	(the motivations that a person has for a particular task). 
	
	Someone may have high \emph{Creativity-Relevant Skills}, such as thinking
	and cognitive styles that are conducive to creativity, or knowledge
	of good heuristics for creative exploration \cite<this is the third
	component of the framework in>\citeA{amabile96}. When coupled with
	high levels of \emph{Domain Relevant Skills} and \emph{Task Motivation}
	for a particular task or domain, \citeA{amabile96} suggests there
	are good prospects for creative behaviour in that domain. Lower levels
	in either of \emph{Domain Relevant Skills} and \emph{Task Motivation}
	do not detract from the person's \emph{Creativity-Relevant Skills}
	(which are domain-general) even if they do reflect in poorer creativity
	in one domain than another.]
	
	Plucker makes a similar point about the role of domain expertise in
	differences in creative ability across domains: \begin{quote} `domain-
	and task-specific capacities are developed as individuals gain expertise
	in specific domains and with specific tasks. The role of expertise
	in the application of creative abilities is rarely the focus of theoretical
	or empirical study and may shed some light on the creativity generality-specificity
	issue.' \cite[p. 180]{plucker98} \end{quote}
	
	CRITICISMS OF DIVERGENT THINKING TESTS Divergent thinking tests have
	been attacked by people such as Baer \cite<e.g.>{baer98} because
	`they measure a context-driven construct in a general manner.'\cite[p.
	181]{plucker98} This argument relies on an assumption that creativity
	is context-dependent and fails if one assumes that a more general
	part of creativity transcends domains. 
	
	[Along the same line of logic, however, one should not use the assumption
	that creativity is context-independent as supporting evidence for
	the validity of divergent thinking tests, as this argument fails
	if the opposite assumption is taken.]
	
	Plucker does concede, though, that other reasons exist for why divergent
	thinking tests should not be over-relied upon, for example to recognise
	that other thinking styles also play a part in creativity (e.g. when
	a creative idea is being evaluated and developed for a particular
	purpose).

  abstract = {Abstract. The question of whether creativity is domain general or
	domain specific is one of the most enduring controversies in the
	field. Strong opinions are regularly shared in support of both positions,
	which has led to a polarization of the debate. The dominant perspective
	currently appears to be that of domain specificity, probably due
	in large part to the pendulum swing toward situated cognition in
	the social sciences in general. However, considerable evidence supports
	the idea that creativity has both specific and general components,
	and that the level of specificity-generality changes with the social
	context and as one develops through childhood into adulthood. The
	authors present their position that creativity is a developmental
	construct that can be viewed as exhibiting both domain-specific and
	domain-general characteristics. Furthermore, they argue that from
	an educational perspective, these distinctions simply are not very
	important. In this chapter, they present their conception of creativity,
	describe why creativity can (and should) be viewed as both context-free
	and context-dependent, and review the theoretical, empirical, and
	educational implications of this conceptualization using a preliminary
	model drawn from their analysis. },
  annote = {Here, Plucker and Beghetto adopt a hybrid position to the debate
	about how creativity is manifested in different domains. They take
	a stance half way between the two poles of this debate, acknowledging
	that some aspects of creativity transcend domains and that other
	aspects of creative behaviour are specialised for that domain. 
	
	\begin{quote} `creativity is a developmental construct that can be
	viewed as exhibiting both domain-specific and domain-general characteristics.
	Furthermore ... these distinctions simply are not very important.'
	\cite[p. 155]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `The optimal condition for creative production is a
	flexible position somewhere between generality and specificity ...
	with the individual or group moving between positions as the task
	or problem of the moment dictates. Specificity downplays the importance
	of outside perspectives, generality overemphasizes the importance
	of all other information, and the hybrid position values perspectives
	from other domains but acknowledges the value of expertise and task
	commitment.' \cite[p. 161]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `Rather than artificially split creativity, domain-specific
	\emph{and} domain-general features of creativity can be examined.
	In doing so, a richer question can be addressed: What aspects of
	creativity are domain general and which aspects are domain specific?'
	\cite[p. 159]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	To answer this: Domain-general - \begin{itemize} \item A person's
	general cognitive abilities and thought processes \item The cognitive
	abilities and thought processes of a person that facilitate them
	being creative \item Social context of the general population for
	judging creativity in people \item Producing a creative outcome or
	product \end{itemize}
	
	Domain-specific - \begin{itemize} \item The interplay between ability
	and the creative process \item Judging achievements in the context
	of the community that is active in that domain \item The preference
	of certain products over others and the criteria for judging products
	\end{itemize}
	
	To summarise, the definition offered by Plucker and Beghetto is domain
	general, but the way the definition is implemented in practice (particularly
	how creativity is assessed) is domain specific: 
	
	\begin{quote} `Creativity is the interplay between ability and process
	by which an individiual or group produces an outcome or product that
	is both novel and useful as defined within some social context.'
	\cite[p. 156]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	
	Looking at Baer's arguments that creativity in one domain is independent
	of creativity in another:
	
	\begin{quote} `Among his [Baer's] arguments are that domain-specific
	performance assessments correlate poorly with each other, and that
	task-specific training programs tend to show only task-specific benefits'
	\cite[p. 154]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	\citeA{baer98} concluded that it was safer to assume domain-specificity
	of creativity rather than domain generality. Plucker and Beghetto
	disagree, and say that creativity should be viewed as both domain-specific
	and domain-general to an extent: \begin{quote} `As we have personally
	retreated from viewing this debate dichotomously, we have come to
	believe that this conceptualization, which is widely held, is incorrect.
	If the question is truly one of determining in what context a person
	is creative, then either view has misleading and unfortunate implications.'
	\cite[p. 160]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	
	
	Plucker and Beghetto consider how people can be skilled in more than
	one domain: 
	
	\begin{quote} `the idea of multipotentiality, one individual having
	the potential to make significant contributions in two or more domains,
	is highly controversial within the education and psychology literature.
	Many scholars believe that multipotentiality exists and can pose
	significant problems as students with numerous talents and interests
	begin to consider important educational, career, and personal decisions
	... However, other researchers argue that evidence of multipotentiality
	is hard to find' \cite[p. 154]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	However this does contribute to a slight red herring in this debate
	about whether creativity is domain-specific or a concept that exists
	across all domains: the issue of whether people who are creative
	in one domain is also creative in other domains, and whether this
	can be used as evidence for or against the domain generality of creativity.
	
	
	Plucker and Beghetto drive home their conclusion that it is detrimental
	to take a strong stance in either assuming domain specificity or
	domain generality: \begin{quote} `too much of either position will
	hinder creativity: A person who continually deals with domain-general
	techniques and approaches to creativity may never scratch the surface
	of a problem, yet someone who focuses tightly for long periods of
	time in a domain or on a particular task is likely to experience
	functional fixedness' \cite[p. 161]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	
	GENIUS VS EVERYDAY CREATIVITY \begin{quote} `The primary implications
	of our position is that it is more important to describe how people
	have chosen to be creative or are viewed by others to be creative
	as opposed to whether they should be called creative at all. The
	``all or nothing'' label simply does not reflect current theory and
	research on creativity, especially given our emphasis on creative
	production.' \cite[p. 160]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	\citeauthor{plucker04} dismiss the notion that people need to reach
	a certain level of knowledge in order to make `meaningful contributions'
	to a domain \cite[p. 163]{plucker04}. Instead they argue that a person
	can be creative in a domain relative to the knowledge they have.
	One might question how useful this is to a broader community, for
	example \citeA{amabile96} stresses the importance of domain expertise
	as part of a creative skillset. However, the points made by \citeauthor{plucker04}
	acknowledge the possibility of \emph{little-c} or \emph{p-creativity}
	creativity that is useful at an individual level of expertise, independently
	of its importance in a wider context.
	
	NEED FOR A DEFINITION \begin{quote} `Explication of a definition of
	creativity is necessary for the study of creativity to continue to
	grow, thrive, and contribute meaningfully to our understanding of
	the processes and outcomes across and within various domains.' \cite[p.
	155]{plucker04} \end{quote}
	
	NOVELTY AND VALUE
	
	\begin{quote} `Two key elements in the definition of creativity are
	novelty (i.e., original, unique, new, fresh, different) and usefulness
	(i.e. specified, valuable, meaningful, relevant, appropriate, worthwhile).
	The combination of these two elements serves as the keystone in scholarly
	discussions and definitions of creativity ... novelty and usefulness
	work in tandem.' \cite[p. 157]{plucker04} \end{quote}

	DIVERGENT THINKING AS CREATIVITY (MOVEMENT AWAY FROM THIS) \begin{quote}
	`Although divergent thinking is often considered to contribute to
	tcreativity, the constructs are not synonymous, and theorists over
	the passt 20 years have moved toward more inclusive models of creativity
	in which divergent thinking plays an important but small role.' \cite[p.
	85]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	Several of the 90 papers on creativity\footnote{sources included 30
	articles from business, education and psychology journal articles
	as well as 30 articles each from the two creativity journals \emph{Creativity
	Research Journal} and the \emph{Journal of Creative Behavior}.} analysed
	by \citeA{plucker04defn} implicitly defined creativity as divergent
	thinking \cite[p. 88]{plucker04defn}.
	
	\begin{quote} `we question whether researchers using these tests have
	seriously considered the theoretical foundations of the measures.
	... Wihtout serious consideration of these issues, implicit and potentially
	outdated definitions of creativity are perpetuated.' \cite[p. 92]{plucker04defn}
	\end{quote}
	
	Although \citeA{plucker04defn} do not go into further detail in this,
	one problem with a standard definition of creativity is that definitions
	will always evolve as language is used over time, so the problem
	of an outdated definition is ongoing and perhaps unavoidable. However
	the suggestion that definitions are stated clearly at the time of
	writing up creativity research is a solution to this problem.
	
	
	
	
	
	MYTHS IN CREATIVITY:
	
	\citeA{plucker04defn} proposes a number of `myths' that pervade and
	hamper creativity research, quoting examples from the literature:
	1. Interpreting creativity as 'Big C' (eminent) rather than 'little
	c' (everyday creativity) \begin{quote} `The myth that people either
	have or do not have creativity, with no capacity for enhancement,
	is one of the most pervasive and stubborn myths surrounding creativity'
	\cite[p. 85]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	2. Treating creativity as individual to, and isolated in, a single
	person rather than considering interative creativity \begin{quote}
	`The ``lone nut'' stereotype of creativity - that of the strange,
	creative loner with a dark side - is surprisingly widespread.' \cite[p.
	86]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	3. Creativity cannot be defined and is not a scientific topic of study.
	\begin{quote} `In courses and at professional conferences, we are
	always astonished at the degree to which people see the stereotypical
	creative person, if not as a dangerous loner, as a barefooted hippie
	running around a commune while rubbing crystals on his forehead.
	This stereotype leads many psychologists to think of creativity as
	``soft psychology,'' even though many of them study related constructs.'
	\cite[p. 86]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	4. Creativity increases with the number of people involved (i.e. a
	group of people are always cumulatively more creative than an individual)
	
	\citeA{plucker04defn} argues that there is a need for - and a lack
	of - a definition of creativity, and that a standard definition is
	important to unify research in a common direction. 
	
	
	NEED FOR CREATIVITY DEFN
	
	A fear of being exact about what is meant by creativity (worried about
	being inaccurate or missing something out) - but otherwise how can
	we compare and contrast computational creativity research progress?
	This cannot be the case for computational creativity evaluation:
	the criteria by which you evaluate should be clearly stated, for
	rigour of approach and to enable comparison and criticism of evaluation
	results. \begin{quote} `researchers do not want to rock the boat
	by carefully considering what really lies behind the curtain of creativity.
	... When a definition of creativity is offered in the literature,
	it often is prefaced with an ``oh, by the way'' tone. It is almost
	as if creativity researchers and practitioners are afraid that, in
	pinning themselves down to a concrete, operational definition, they
	will somehow destroy the complexity and fascination that the construct
	generates (and offend their peers in the field in the process).'
	\cite[p. 87]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `Examples in which authors explicitly state their definition
	... are rare. Without an aggreed-on definition of the construct,
	creativity's potential contributions to psychology and eduction will
	remain limited.' \cite[p. 87]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `unless the definitional problem is addressed, creativity
	research will continue to be impeded by lack of direction, damaging
	mythologies, and general misunderstanding.' \cite[p. 92]{plucker04defn}
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `we argue that creativity researchers must (a) explicitly
	define what they mean by creativity, (b) avoid using scores of creativity
	measures as the sole definition of creativity (e.g., creativity is
	what creativity tests measure and creatvitiy tests measure creativity,
	therefore we will use a score on a creativity test as our outcome
	variable), (c) discuss how the definition they are using is similar
	to or different from other definitions, and (d) address the question
	of creativity for whom and in what context.' \cite[p. 92]{plucker04defn}
	\end{quote}
	
	
	
	\begin{quote} `In very few cases, the author presented a precise definition
	of creativity early in the article' \cite[p. 88]{plucker04defn} \end{quote}
	
	Interestingly, \citeA{plucker04defn} does not offer any definition
	of creativity of their own until page 90 - eight pages into the article
	- and this definition section seems to be included only after a suggestion
	by a reviewer of the article during the review process. This definition
	is arrived at by noticing what themes re-occured and forming these
	into an inclusive definition: \begin{quote} `Creativity is the interaction
	among \emph{aptitude, process, and environment} by which an individual
	or group produces a \emph{perceptible product} that is both \emph{novel
	and useful} as defined within a \emph{social context}' \cite[p. 90]{plucker04defn}
	\end{quote} c.f. Person, Process, Press, Product - all are required
	
	\begin{quote} `In explicitly defining creativity, we are not suggesting
	that researchers necessarily adopt our definition, just that they
	clearly define what they mean by creativity and (when appropriate)
	the empirical indicators of that definition.' \cite[p. 92]{plucker04defn}
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `the use of a creativity measure would benefit from
	an accompanying definition of creativity as well as an explanation
	of how the particular measure does (and does not) meet the definition
	of creativity being used. Also, when providing a definition of creativity
	(particularly if it is a novel definition), it is important to explain
	how this definition is or is not similar to other definitions in
	the literature. In doing so, consumers of research will be in a better
	position to be aware of cumulative findigns as well as determining
	whether contradictory findings are the result of comparing dissimilar
	lines of work or if other factors are accounting for those differential
	findings (e.g. methods, population). Finally, specifying the context
	and stakeholders is important in clarifying the parameteres in which
	the definition and study results apply.'' \cite[pp. 92-93]{plucker04defn}

	`In a word, is not the subliminal self superior to the conscious self!'

	`Among the great numbers of combinations blindly formed by the subliminal
	self, almost all are without interest and without utility; but just
	for that reason they are also without effect upon the esthetic sensibility.
	Consciousness will never know them; only certain ones are harmonious,
	and, consequently, at once useful and beautiful. They will be capable
	of ... [calling] our attention to them, and thus give them occasion
	to become conscious.'\cite[p. 392]{poincare29} Refers to the `sudden
	illumination [that] seizes upon the mind of the mathematician' as
	a possible confirmation of the above hypothesis. = inspiration
	
	p. 393 contains Poincare's description of the [=incubation] stage,
	which allows the `subliminal self' to explore combinations, unhindered
	by conscious thought. Also a `preliminary period of conscious work'
	\cite[p. 393]{poincare29} is needed to set up `atoms' or `elements'
	which the subliminal self can later work upon. = preparation
	
	A `second period of conscious work ... follows the inspiration, ...
	in which one verifies the results of this inspiration and deduces
	their consequences.' \cite[p. 394]{poincare29} = verification
	
	
	The translation in \cite{poincare29} is preceded by a foreword (in
	English) from Poincar\'e. It is interesting that in an alternative
	translation (the unattributed 1914 translation quoted by \citeA{wallas26},
	the title of this chapter is translated as `Mathematical Invention'
	rather than `Mathematical Creation': in other words `invention' and
	`creation' are interchanged.},

	Teaching computers to play jazz
	
	Can a computer swing? Sure it can, if you hang it up by a rope and
	kick it hard enough. No, man, what I'm saying is: can a digital cat
	play jazz? Jazz, the apotheosis of cool, the fiery crucible of 20th-century
	musical authenticity, the spontaneous outpouring of one man or woman's
	artistic self-expression through the irreducibly physical medium
	of a sax, a trumpet, a piano, a double bass? Yeah - nice. Ah well:
	that's one citadel of humanity, surely, that could never be stormed
	by the creeping hordes of artificial intelligence.
	
	Never? Better think twice, as that well-known jazz artiste C{\'e}line
	Dion might put it. A couple of weeks ago on BBC1's Tomorrow's World,
	Courtney Pine was jamming along on his soprano to the sounds of a
	computerised jazz quartet. Nothing unusual there: computers have
	been able to provide adequate, if stiff-backed, accompaniment to
	practising soloists for years. But then Pine stopped blowing - and
	another, invisible saxophone continued to play with impressive fluidity
	and melodic interest across the harmonies, sounding weirdly like
	the late giant of the alto sax, Charlie Parker. Extraordinarily,
	this was the work of a computer program, Improvisor, and - crucially
	- the ghostly sax was not just playing a predetermined line, it was
	making it up as it went along in real time, just like a real jazz
	musician does.
	
	The necromancer responsible for summoning up this digital revenant
	is the jazz musician Paul Hodgson, who has played alto saxophone
	with such luminaries as Andy Sheppard and Keith Tippett, and who
	is also a skilled programmer. His interest in the subject began in
	the 1980s, when he was working as a peripatetic music teacher, trying
	to teach children how to play jazz. He knocked up a program that,
	while playing the chords of a song, would analyse the harmony to
	work out and play a mode for the current stage of the tune (a ``mode''
	is a kind of altered scale). His students could then listen and pick
	up the appropriate modes as they went along, to give them some basic
	building blocks for soloing.
	
	In the meantime, Hodgson began to wonder whether he could get the
	computer itself to generate an interesting solo. And that is where
	Charlie Parker comes in. ``I started analysing lots of Parker solos,''
	Hodgson remembers, ``trying to look for patterns and repetitive structures
	that he was using, and seeing if I could work out a way in which
	these solos could actually be put together. I abstracted out sets
	of variable-length patterns from different solos, and then I started
	working on ways of applying these patterns to different tunes, to
	create new solos. And that's basically what you heard on television.''
	
	Ah yes, ``patterns''. In jazz, the term ``pattern'' can denote a group
	of notes which a musician learns to play at speed in all 12 keys
	until it can be instantly recalled during a solo - the notes fall
	naturally under the fingers, leaving the musician's brain free to
	figure out what to play next. Some musicians don't do any more than
	this. An unimpressed (or plain envious) jazzer might damn a colleague
	with the gravelly expletive: ``patterner''. In this way, the method
	of the program Improvisor is close to the way a mediocre musician
	operates. But does the fact that Parker's style can be imitated by
	the computer mean that even the great Bird was a mere patterner himself?
	
	Of course not. ``It doesn't actually tell you how the patterns were
	created in the first place,'' Hodgson observes. ``Parker might use
	similar patterns, but he modifies and sculpts them to the context
	of the music that he's playing.'' That said, Hodgson has found to
	his surprise that the computer comes up with phrases that he has
	never heard Bird use: ``It's actually creating new stuff - and some
	of it is bloody good. This is an emergent property of the program,
	and it raises the question of whether Bird's style could evolve further
	in cyberspace.'' And would the real Charlie Parker have relished
	the prospect of his electronic spectre haunting the Web and refining
	his own riffs in future decades? He probably would have said it was
	wild, and shuffled off to the nearest bar.
	
	Hodgson has concluded that one aspect of creativity is the way an
	artist chooses patterns and puts them together. ``It does apply to
	painting as well: Picasso and so on,'' he murmurs. ``You've only
	got to look at 20th-century art and abstract painting to see that
	there are lots of common patterns that artists are using, and they
	reappear in different paintings and different forms.'' Still, adroit
	choices of pattern alone do not a jazz artist make. ``At the genius
	level I haven't learned very much{\ldots} In fact it's incredibly
	difficult to really improvise and there are very, very few people
	around that can really do it. It's just so hard.''
	
	So hard, in fact, that even some top-flight commercial musicians can't
	do it. The rock alto-saxist David Sanborn (the one on David Bowie's
	Young Americans), admitted to the world last year that he doesn't
	really improvise, but just strings together blues licks. Yet the
	reason Sanborn is so popular is not the notes he plays but the sound
	he makes - that uniquely raspy, squealing voice that writhes around
	right at the top of his instrument's range. If you add to Hodgson's
	melodic calculations something to account for this idiosyncratic
	control of timbre in real time, the computation becomes forbiddingly
	complex. And, of course, any real jazz musician is always listening
	and responding to what everyone else in the band is doing - which
	Improvisor doesn't do. There'll be no strange-trousered silicon stars
	of free jazz for a good while - if ever.
	
	Courtney Pine's own verdict on the computer program was interestingly
	mixed. Hodgson relates that on the first take, which the BBC didn't
	show because of the sax-player's pungent language, Pine exclaimed
	that it was ``Bloody brilliant!''. Pine currently uses samplers in
	his live sets, and this, he said, was a more ``expressive'' development
	that he could envisage using to expand his sound. But as for replacing
	human musicians - well, no cigar yet. ``You can't replace the human
	experience, the human feel,'' Pine smiled. ``What's missing, I suppose,
	is some of the soul, some of the spirit.''
	
	Indeed, Hodgson's own researches have brought him to the conclusion
	(a polemical one among the computing fraternity) that the idea of
	a top-flight artificial musician is an oxymoron. ``To create music
	you have to be alive in the world. It's not possible.'' What he is
	now looking at instead are ways to use his system to create new musical
	interfaces - for disabled children, and for artists working in other
	media: computerised image-tracking could provide an instantaneous
	soundtrack for a ballet, or future disco queens could alter a record's
	sound with flailing limbs. There are noises of interest from the
	Science Museum and the Millennium Dome.
	
	In a way, this work has pleasingly come full circle: from trying to
	replicate human creativity electronically, to producing an electronic
	tool that can be used to enhance human creativity. This will be a
	relief to people who prefer to snap their fingers at a real, groovy-shirted
	person on stage, rather than nod their heads at an offensively beige,
	Microsoft-infected lump of extruded plastic. And Phil Hodgson goes
	further to sound a blue note of warning: ``Maybe there's an in-principle
	limit to what we can do. It's our quest to eat from the tree of knowledge
	and be completely knowledgeable about everything in the world - and
	in so doing, what we could easily do is destroy it, by building things
	that don't have any spiritual consciousness and become out of our
	control.''
	
	With that unpalatable scenario ringing in our ears, perhaps it's best
	to go back to the old records again. After all, a computer might
	study ``Ornithology'', but it'll never know how it feels to fly.},

	Court has ruled in numerous cases that an invention is an idea rather
	than an object. If a man can prove that an idea was his by demonstrating
	or providing evidence that only he had the knowledge from which it
	was synthesised, he can claim patent to the invention.' \cite[p.
	305]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY
	
	\begin{quote} `The word creativity is a noun naming the phenomenon
	in which a person communicates a new concept (which is the product).
	Mental activity (or mental process) is implicit in this definition,
	and of course no one could conceive of a person living or operating
	in a vacuum, so the term \emph{press} is also implicit.' \cite[p.
	305]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	WHAT IS NOVELTY - NOVELTY AS A SCALE
	
	\begin{quote} `The definition [p. 305] begs the question as to how
	new the concept must be and to whom it must be new.' \cite[p. 305]{rhodes61}
	\end{quote}
	
	\begin{quote} `A system is needed for classifying products according
	to the scope of newness. ... The significance of this suggestion
	to classify ideas by degree of newness is that it would place emphasis
	on higher mental processes rather than on dazzling objects.' \cite[p.

	GENIUS VS EVERYDAY CREATIVITY - Rhodes: everyday creativity which
	can be developed \cite{rhodes61} MYSTERY OF CREATIVITY - Rhodes:
	creativity is not something mysterious \cite{rhodes61} CONSCIOUS
	vs UNCONSCIOUS - Rhodes: Creativity is more about thinking than feeling
	\cite{rhodes61}
	
	Research since Guilford has `rendered into baloney many former sacred
	cows. For instance ... the idea that people are born to be either
	creative or lacking in creative ability, the notion that creativity
	is more a way of feeling than a way of thinking, the idea that creativity
	is something mysterious, and the notion that the word creativity
	applies to a simple, uncomplicated mental process that operates in
	restraint.' \cite[p. 306]{rhodes61}.
	
	NEED FOR A DEFINITION MULTI-FACETED NATURE OF CREATIVITY Rhodes quotes
	from \citeA{barzun60} \cite[p. 306]{rhodes61}: \begin{quote} `What
	``creative'' means in common usage is hardly clear ... Use of the
	word creativity is a device by which we give ourselves easy satisfactions
	while avoiding necessary judgments.' \cite{barzun60} \end{quote}
	
	to illustrate his point that creativity is multi-faceted: \begin{quote}
	`the words creative and creativity have been loosely used and overused.
	... What is happening here is that a word which should be reserved
	to name a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon is misused to name only
	one prat of a phenomenon.' \cite[p. 306]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	NEED FOR A DEFINITION
	
	\begin{quote} `I submit that the time has come for more precision
	in definition and usage [of the word creativity], that only when
	the field is analyzed and organized - when the listener can be sure
	he knows what the speaker is talking about - will the pseudo aspect
	of the subject of creativity disappear.' \cite[p. 310]{rhodes61}
	\end{quote}
	
	Rhodes stresses how we should `not throw out the baby with the bath
	water just because the water is cloudy.' \cite[p. 310]{rhodes61}.
	
	LOTS OF DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF CREATIVITY
	
	Over a period of about five years looking for definitions of creativity
	(and also imagination, originality, and ingenuity), Rhodes has collected
	40 definitions of creativity, many of which overlap and have elements
	in common. 
	
	\begin{quote} `I had collected forty definitions of creativity and
	sixteen of imagination. The profusion was enough to give one the
	impression that creativity is a province for pseudo-intellectuals.'
	\cite[p. 306]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	FOUR Ps
	
	After analysis of these definitions, four dimensions of creativity
	emerge: \begin{quote} `One of these strands pertains essentially
	to the person as a human being. Another strand pertains to the mental
	processes that are operative in creating ideas. A third strand pertains
	to the influence of the ecological press on the person and upon his
	mental processes. And the fourth strand pertains to ideas. Ideas
	are usually expressed in the form of either language or craft and
	this is what we call product. Hereafter, I shall refer to these strands
	as the four P's of creativity, i.e., (1) person, (2) processes, (3)
	press, (4) products.' \cite[p. 307]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	PERSON Rhodes mentions the relevance to creativity of people's personality
	traits, attitudes and habits, physique and intelligence and the identifiable
	features of creative people, as well as referring to people's temperament,
	habits, self-concept, value systems, defense mechanisms, and behavior.
	\begin{quote} `The term \emph{person}, as used here, covers information
	about personality, intellect, temperament, physique, traits, habits,
	attitudes, self-concept, value systems, defense mechanisms, and behavior.'
	\cite[p. 307]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	PROCESS
	
	In considering the creative process, Rhodes refers to the work of
	Wallas and comments from Helmholtz, seeing the creative process comprising
	the four stages of preparation, incubation, inspiration and verification
	\cite{wallas26}.
	
	PRESS \begin{quote} `The term \emph{press} refers to the relationship
	between human beings and their environment.' \cite[p. 308]{rhodes61}
	\end{quote}
	
	Rhodes concentrates on the role that the environment plays on a person
	during the creative process, rather than how the creative produce
	is judged by the external world after being created. He reflects
	on how everyone is different, so everyone perceives the world in
	a unique way and processes ideas according to their own internal
	makeup and experiences.
	
	PRODUCTS \begin{quote} `When an idea becomes embodied in tangible
	form it is called a \emph{product}. ... Products are artifacts of
	thoughts.' \cite[p. 309]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE FOUR Ps
	
	Mysterious impression of creativity can be explained to some extent
	if we do not take into account all of the four Ps when considering
	creativity.
	
	\begin{quote} `Each strand [of the four Ps] has unique identity academically,
	but only in unity do the four strands operate functionaly. It is
	this very fact of synthesis that causes fog in talk about creativity
	and this may be the basis for the semblance of a ``cult''.' \cite[p.
	307]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	Rhodes argues that investigating and studying creativity should follow
	a very definite path. \begin{quote} `Objective investigation into
	the nature of the creative process can proceed in only one direction,
	i.e. from product to person and thence to process and to press.'
	\cite[p. 309]{rhodes61} \end{quote}
	
	[I would disagree with him on this - for example press has great influence
	on the process, such that you may prefer to study how press and person
	interact before being led to look at process.

	task of creating stories for the purposes of entertaining, educating,
	and training has tradi- tionally been the purview of humans. This
	sets up the conditions for a creative authoring bottleneck where
	the consumption of stories outpaces the production of stories by
	human professional creators. The automation of story creation may
	scale up the ability to produce and deliver novel, meaningful story
	artifacts. From this practical perspective, story generation systems
	replicate the creative abilities of humans and can thus be considered
	instances of computational creativity. Com- putational systems that
	are purported to be creative typically utilize one of three general
	approaches: exploration of a space of concepts, combination of concepts,
	and transformation of concepts. In this article we present an approach
	to story generation that utilize exploration, combination, and transformation.
	Our approach, implemented in the Vignette Based Partial Order Causal
	Link story planner, is an algorithm that searches through a space
	of possible story solutions, guided by combinations of existing story
	fragments called vignettes. The vignettes are made relevant to novel
	story generation contexts through an automated transformation pre-process.
	Through these processes, we show that story generation can incorporate
	multiple perspectives on computational creativity. Our approach is
	presented at both the theoretical and technical levels.},

	The purpose of most story authoring is not to invent a new style

	story generation systems are more limited than human authors in the

	case that story generation systems are constrained to operate within
	a fixed representation of the story world. These limitations can
	impact whether a story generation system is considered creative or

	Fabulist however is constrained by the world model input by the system
	user. We present two algorithms that enable story planningsystems
	such as Fabulist to break outside the bounds of the initial world
	model in order to search a larger space of narratives.},

	From abstract - ``It is important to be explicit, and if possible
	formal, about the criteria that are being applied in making judgements
	of creativity'' (p. 3) i.e. state and be clear about what standards
	you are evaluating to. Aim of paper is to ``set down criteria for
	a program ``being creative'' '' (p. 4) Introduction --- No way of
	directly assessing computational creativity yet (as of time of writing):
	``any such mechanism [of creative computation] has to be judged on
	how successful it is, as there is no direct way to assess the inherent
	creativity of a computational mechanism.'' (p. 3) ``To judge the
	(creative) success of a program, we have to have a clear notion of
	what we mean by a program ``being creative''. Without that, discussion
	of the pros and cons of different internal mechanisms are just speculation.''
	(p. 3) [Would have been nice to see Ritchie demonstrate how his criteria
	could be implemented in assessment - the closest we get is in Ritchie
	et al 2007: briefly touches on Ritchies criteria but states that
	"these criteria are insufficiently subtle for making fine comparisons
	of creativity" (Ritchie et al IJWCC 2007, p. 97)] Ritchie states
	straight away that his assessment methodology concentrates on actual
	artefacts produced by a system - so if systems only produce abstract
	results (Ritchie's example is analogies) then Ritchie's proposals
	will not be valid. 
	
	Creativity judgements --- Talks about creativity in different domains
	and the ``intellectual apartheid'' that artistic activities are easier
	to view as being creative even if mediocre, whereas scientific activities
	are only viewed as creative if done very well. Ritchie's framework
	is an attempt to make different domains more amenable to fair comparisons
	in this way. Ironically, even in a section where Ritchie is trying
	to avoid ``the prejudice in favour of ``art'' against ``science''
	'' (p. 4), he discusses how the quality of a creative product has
	`` ``artistic'' value '' 1 paragraph later (p. 4). Introduces the
	idea of P-creativity and how a system produces novelty relative to
	what it already knows - preparing the way for introducing the notion
	of the inspiring set. Ritchie prioritises Novelty and Quality, as
	the main tests of creativity, disregarding other ``subsidiary tests
	of creativity'' (p4) e.g. the autonomy of the creator during work.
	This isn't really justified except by this statement (p. 4) ``If
	a person produces a painting which is radically different from previous
	work ... and which is definitely a good painting, then that will
	usually be deemed creative. What is rarely brought into the assessment
	is \emph{how} the person came up with the idea/artefact, that is,
	the thought processes by which the result came into being.'' This
	is said as a statement which is supposedly obviously true, though
	it is not backed up in any way and it is more than reasonable to
	doubt the accuracy of this statement, as many authors have (e.g.
	Colton, Pease et al, Kaufman, Odena, Boden, Rhodes). Although Ritchie
	concedes in the next paragraph that computational creativity assessment
	is ``slightly more complex'', this only manifests itself in the criteria
	as different interpretations of novelty and quality, as opposed to
	taking anything else into account. Later in the paper (p. 7) Ritchie
	makes a similar statement with similar lack of justification: ``Consider
	appraising the output of a generating program in isolation, without
	knowledge of the program's construction or internal workings. This
	is comparable to the assessment which people routinely make of human-created
	artefacts.'' Colton 2008 provides some counter examples to this,
	for example conceptual art, or his thought experiment comparing our
	perception of two identical paintings that were produced in different
	ways. Ritchie's interpretation of Boden's The Creative Mind: how
	''a creative achievement produces an artefact (abstract or concrete)
	which not only is significantly different from previous exemplars,
	but also establishes new norms by which further exemplars may be
	classified and judged'' (p. 4) Also ``it is not unknown for critics
	of AI to refuse to accept programs as creative (or intelligent) once
	the mundane mechanistic nature of the inner workings are revealed''
	(p. 4). [Colton's suggestion to prevent this is to discuss the workings
	of systems in high-level terms only, rather than in greater detail.]
	Ritchie is very cautious in the language he uses: he continually
	uses 'could' and 'may' (e.g. [my emphasis added] p. 4: ``define ..
	the attributes one \emph{might} look for in order to decide whether
	or not a particular computer program had behaved creatively'', p.
	7: ``[we] state some criteria which \emph{could} be applied in deciding
	how creative a program is, or has been.'') Consistently states that
	this work is in early stages and could be developed. [Q. how is the
	language in 2007 update paper?] Advocates post-hoc analysis of products,
	not including any examination of the creative process. Provides an
	overall framework to describe the derivation, implementation and
	running of a creative computational system in formal/set-theoretic
	definitions. Two key mappings introduced - a rating for typicality
	and a rating for value. The typicality rating is introduced to account
	for the issue that computational systems aren't guaranteed to produce
	artefacts that match what is being aimed for; so artefacts need to
	be assesed in terms of how good an example they are of items in the
	target domain. Further to this, an artefact may be typical of the
	domain but not be a good example, so the value rating is introduced
	to assess the quality of that artefact (independently of whether
	it is typical of the norm in that domain). [These two ratings, although
	distinct in Ritchie's definitions, are difficult to separate completely
	in implementation, particularly if the two ratings are being produced
	by user assessment. This was found in my GA paper for ICCCX. Ritchie
	proposes that ratings schemes be formally outlined to avoid this
	problem; another solution is to phrase the questions to users very
	carefully, as is done to good effect in the example quoted by Ritchie:
	Binstead, Pain and Ritchie 1997.] The criteria (14 in this paper,
	18 in 2007 paper with some accuracy revisions to the formalisations
	of existing criteria and 4 new criteria added) are offered by Ritchie
	as points which may or may not be important for creativity in a particular
	system, depending on individual views of creativity. The criteria
	can be combined in different ways, weighted or left out entirely
	according to what is important for that domain. Unfortunately this
	also leads to possibilities for the unscrupulous researcher to manipulate
	the criteria to show off their system in the best possible light.
	p: 8: ``A framework such as the one outlined here allows for multiple
	definitions of creativity (or definitions of different styles or
	levels of creativity). ... the set of Criteria listed here should
	be considered as a repertoire from which one might draw. The fact
	that different Criteria seem to lead in different directions with
	respect to the underlying intuition about creativity is not a problem
	[NB especially given the somewhat contradictory nature of creativity].
	Rather, one can define different variants by suitable choies and
	combinations of criteria.'' As well as weighting the contributions
	of individual criteria, each criteria has various parameters from:
	\alpha, \beta, \gamma and \theta. These parameters can be set to
	further customise the criteria to suit individual definitions of
	creativity for different domains or systems (but again are open to
	potential exploitation or accidental over-estimation/under-estimation
	of creative levels). Informal description of the 14 criteria: (These
	criteria are deliberately summarised in quite an informal way here.
	I acknowledge that this will lead to some loss in exact semantics
	compared to the formal version of the criteria but it is hoped that
	these descriptions will give an intuitive sense of the general idea
	behind each criterion. Where I have used words such as 'suitable'
	or 'decent' or 'appropriate' or 'high', this is to replace parameters
	such as \alpha, \beta etc whose exact values are left unspecified
	by Ritchie) 1 On average, the system should produce suitably typical
	output 2 A decent proportion of the output should be suitably typical
	3 On average, the system should produce highly valued output 4 A
	decent proportion of the output should be highly valued 5 A decent
	proportion of the output should be both suitably typical and highly
	valued 6 A decent proportion of the output is suitably atypical and
	highly valued 7 A decent proportion of the atypical output is highly
	valued 8 A decent proportion of the valuable output is suitably atypical
	9 The system can replicate many of the example artefacts that guided
	construction of the system (the \emph{inspiring set}) 10 Much of
	the output of the system is not in the inspiring set, so is novel
	to the system 11 Novel output of the system (i.e. not in the inspiring
	set) should be suitably typical 12 Novel output of the system (i.e.
	not in the inspiring set) should be highly valued 13 A large proportion
	of the output should be suitably typical items that are not in the
	inspiring set 14 A large proportion of the output should be highly
	valued items that are not in the inspiring set 15 (added 2007) 16
	(added 2007) 17 (added 2007) 18 (added 2007) One wonders if the main
	selection justification for criteria to be included in the set above
	is mainly because it is possible to express them in the formalisation
	that Ritchie has done and because they could feasibly be linked to
	creativity, but this is maybe an unfair criticism given that Ritchie
	does not talk about any potential criteria that he has considered
	and rejected. Viewpoints Subjective issues in creativity assessment:
	ratings and appraisals are subjective and depend on the particular
	judge's opinions, background knowledge and even perhaps on their
	mood that day. Ritchie outlines this as a problem but offers no practical
	solution such as using a number of different judges. No general agreement
	of what it means to be creative. Ritchie outlines how the criteria
	can be customised to different definitions of creativity, but it
	isn't really in the scope of this paper to make a definition of creativity
	using the criteria (although perhaps it would have been useful for
	Ritchie to attempt this, to demonstrate how the criteria could be
	used in a particular domain or for one of the systems Ritchie is
	involved in the development of - he cites Binsted et al 1997 as an
	example where the ratings for typicality and value are already available
	so could have used these in a demonstration of the criteria in use).
	Criteria 9-14 rely on an 'inspiring set' which is the knowledge or
	examples from which the program is constructed to generate new examples.
	Ritchie acknowledges that sometimes the information in this set may
	not be available, for example there are no examples used directly
	by the system to generate new examples, but does not make practical
	recommendations for how the criteria should be applied in this situation.
	In general, Ritchie's proposals deal with, or at least acknowledge,
	a lot of theoretical issues. However they are relatively problematic
	to implement in practice in evaluation: there are a lot of variables
	left up to the choice of the evaluator, which could possibly be taken
	advantage of for a more favourable evaluation of a particular system
	(e.g. weight highly the criteria which the system performs well against,
	or tweak parameters to best fit the system's interpretation of creativity).
	It is difficult to specify these details more decisively, though,
	because of the subjective nature of creativity. What has happened
	in practice (e.g. Gervas et al, Pereira et al, Haenen and Rauchas,
	Jordanous :p ) is that researchers have chosen arbitrary levels for
	each of the parameters, or used parameter values chosen by previous
	researchers in order to compare two systems against each other on
	the same criteria settings. Also each criteria has been weighted
	equally: an approach which makes comparisons between systems easier
	but which Ritchie has criticised for being an inappropriate use of
	the criteria, not making full use of the power of the whole approach.
	To deal with the problem of choosing values for the parameters \alpha,
	\beta, \gamma and \theta, and weights for each criterion, Ritchie
	suggests generating values based on extrapolating from human assessment
	(essentially turning this into a supervised learning problem). This
	is multi-dimensional though, and non-linear - perhaps this problem
	could be solved via some machine learning technique such as neural
	networks, but it would need to be a technique that you could extract
	internal parameter values from: this may rule out neural networks
	due to their 'black-box' nature.},

  abstract = {In this poignant, funny follow-up to his fabled 2006 talk, Sir Ken
	Robinson makes the case for a radical shift from standardized schools
	to personalized learning -- creating conditions where kids' natural
	talents can flourish. Why you should listen to him: Why don't we
	get the best out of people? Sir Ken Robinson argues that it's because
	we've been educated to become good workers, rather than creative
	thinkers. Students with restless minds and bodies -- far from being
	cultivated for their energy and curiosity -- are ignored or even
	stigmatized, with terrible consequences. "We are educating people
	out of their creativity," Robinson says. It's a message with deep
	resonance. Robinson's TEDTalk has been distributed widely around
	the Web since its release in June 2006. The most popular words framing
	blog posts on his talk? "Everyone should watch this." A visionary
	cultural leader, Sir Ken led the British government's 1998 advisory
	committee on creative and cultural education, a massive inquiry into
	the significance of creativity in the educational system and the
	economy, and was knighted in 2003 for his achievements. His latest
	book, The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything, a
	deep look at human creativity and education, was published in January
	2009. "Ken's vision and expertise is sought by public and commercial
	organizations throughout the world." BBC Radio 4 Transcript: ---------------
	I was here four years ago, and I remember, at the time, that the
	talks weren't put online; I think they were given to TEDsters in
	a box, a box set of DVDs, which they put on their shelves, where
	they are now. (Laughter) And actually Chris called me a week after
	I'd given my talk and he said, "We're going to start putting them
	online. Can we put yours online?" And I said, "Sure." And four years
	later, as I said, it's been seen by four ... Well, it's been downloaded
	four million times. So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or
	something to get the number of people who've seen it. And as Chris
	says, there is a hunger for videos of me. (Laughter) (Applause) ...
	don't you feel? (Laughter) So, this whole event has been an elaborate
	build-up to me doing another one for you, so here it is. (Laughter)
	Al Gore spoke at the TED Conference I spoke at four years ago and
	talked about the climate crisis. And I referenced that at the end
	of my last talk. So I want to pick up from there because I only had
	18 minutes, frankly. So, as I was saying... (Laughter) You see, he's
	right. I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously. And I
	think if people don't believe it, they should get out more. (Laughter)
	But I believe there's a second climate crisis, which is as severe,
	which has the same origins, and that we have to deal with with the
	same urgency. And I mean by this -- and you may say, by the way,
	"Look, I'm good. I have one climate crisis; I don't really need the
	second one." But this is a crisis of, not natural resources, though
	I believe that's true, but a crisis of human resources. I believe,
	fundamentally, as many speakers have said during the past few days,
	that we make very poor use of our talents. Very many people go through
	their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may
	be, or if they have any to speak of. I meet all kinds of people who
	don't think they're really good at anything. Actually, I kind of
	divide the world into two groups now. Jeremy Bentham, the great utilitarian
	philosopher, once spiked this argument. He said, "There are two types
	of people in this world, those who divide the world into two types
	and those who do not." (Laughter) Well, I do. (Laughter) I meet all
	kinds of people who don't enjoy what they do. They simply go through
	their lives getting on with it. They get no great pleasure from what
	they do. They endure it, rather than enjoy it, and wait for the weekend.
	But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn't imagine
	doing anything else. If you said to them, "Don't do this anymore,"
	they'd wonder what you were talking about. Because it isn't what
	they do, it's who they are. They say, "But this is me, you know.
	It would be foolish for me to abandon this, because it speaks to
	my most authentic self." And it's not true of enough people. In fact,
	on the contrary, I think it's certainly a minority of people. And
	I think there are many possible explanations for it. And high among
	them is education, because education, in a way, dislocates very many
	people from their natural talents. And human resources are like natural
	resources; they're often buried deep. You have to go looking for
	them. They're not just lying around on the surface. You have to create
	the circumstances where they show themselves. And you might imagine
	education would be the way that happens. But too often, it's not.
	Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment.
	And it's not enough. Reform is no use anymore, because that's simply
	improving a broken model. What we need -- and the word's been used
	many times during the course of the past few days -- is not evolution,
	but a revolution in education. This has to be transformed into something
	else. (Applause) One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally
	in education. Innovation is hard because it means doing something
	that people don't find very easy for the most part. It means challenging
	what we take for granted, things that we think are obvious. The great
	problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense,
	things that people think, "Well, it can't be done any other way because
	that's the way it's done." I came across a great quote recently from
	Abraham Lincoln, who I thought you'd be pleased to have quoted at
	this point. (Laughter) He said this in December 1862 to the second
	annual meeting of Congress. I ought to explain that I have no idea
	what was happening at the time. We don't teach American history in
	Britain. (Laughter) We suppress it. You know, this is our policy.
	(Laughter) So, no doubt, something fascinating was happening in December
	1862, which the Americans among us will be aware of. But he said
	this: "The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy
	present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must
	rise with the occasion." I love that. Not rise to it, rise with it.
	"As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew We must disenthrall
	ourselves and then we shall save our country." I love that word,
	"disenthrall." You know what it means? That there are ideas that
	all of us are enthralled to, which we simply take for granted as
	the natural order of things, the way things are. And many of our
	ideas have been formed, not to meet the circumstances of this century,
	but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries. But our
	minds are still hypnotized by them. And we have to disenthrall ourselves
	of some of them. Now, doing this is easier said than done. It's very
	hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted. And the
	reason is that you take it for granted. So let me ask you something
	that you may take for granted. How many of you here are over the
	age of 25? That's not what I think you take for granted. I'm sure
	you're familiar with that already. Are there any people here under
	the age of 25? Great. Now, those over 25, could you put your hands
	up if you're wearing a wristwatch? Now that's a great deal of us,
	isn't it? Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing. Teenagers
	do not wear wristwatches. I don't mean they can't or they're not
	allowed to, they just often choose not to. And the reason is, you
	see, that we were brought up in a pre-digital culture, those of us
	over 25. And so for us, if you want to know the time, you have to
	wear something to tell it. Kids now live in a world which is digitized,
	and the time, for them, is everywhere. They see no reason to do this.
	And, by the way, you don't need to do it either; it's just that you've
	always done it, and you carry on doing it. My daughter never wears
	a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20. She doesn't see the point. As
	she says, "It's a single function device." (Laughter) "Like, how
	lame is that?" And I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well." (Laughter)
	"It has multiple functions." But you see, there are things we're
	enthralled to in education. Let me give you a couple of examples.
	One of them is the idea of linearity, that it starts here, and you
	go through a track, and if you do everything right, you will end
	up set for the rest of your life. Everybody who's spoken at TED has
	told us implicitly, or sometimes explicitly, a different story, that
	life is not linear, it's organic. We create our lives symbiotically
	as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help
	to create for us. But you know, we have become obsessed with this
	linear narrative. And probably the pinnacle for education is getting
	into college. I think we are obsessed with getting people to college,
	certain sorts of college. I don't mean you shouldn't go to college,
	but not everybody needs to go, and not everybody needs to go now.
	Maybe they go later, not right away. And I was up in San Francisco
	a while ago doing a book signing. There was this guy buying a book,
	he was in his 30s. And I said, "What do you do?" And he said, "I'm
	a fireman." And I said, "How long have you been a fireman?" He said,
	"Always, I've always been a fireman." And I said, "Well, when did
	you decide?" He said, "As a kid." He said, "Actually, it was a problem
	for me at school, because at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."
	He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman." And he said, "When I got
	to the senior year of school, my teachers didn't take it seriously.
	This one teacher didn't take it seriously. He said I was throwing
	my life away if that's all I chose to do with it, that I should go
	to college, I should become a professional person, that I had great
	potential, and I was wasting my talent to do that." And he said,
	"It was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class,
	and I really felt dreadful. But it's what I wanted, and as soon as
	I left school, I applied to the fire service and I was accepted."
	And he said, "You know, I was thinking about that guy recently, just
	a few minutes ago when you were speaking, about this teacher," he
	said, "because six months ago, I saved his life." (Laughter) He said,
	"He was in a car wreck, and I pulled him out, gave him CPR, and I
	saved his wife's life as well." He said, "I think he thinks better
	of me now." (Laughter) (Applause) You know, to me, human communities
	depend upon a diversity of talent, not a singular conception of ability.
	And at the heart of our challenges -- (Applause) At the heart of
	the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence.
	This linearity thing is a problem. When I arrived in L.A. about nine
	years ago, I came across a policy statement, very well-intentioned,
	which said, "College begins in kindergarten." No, it doesn't. (Laughter)
	It doesn't. If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't. (Laughter)
	Kindergarten begins in kindergarten. (Laughter) A friend of mine
	once said, "You know, a three year-old is not half a six year-old."
	(Laughter) (Applause) They're three. But as we just heard in this
	last session, there's such competition now to get to kindergarten,
	to get to the right kindergarten, that people are being interviewed
	for it at three. Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels, you
	know, with their resumes, (Laughter) flipping through and saying,
	"Well, this is it?" (Laughter) (Applause) "You've been around for
	36 months, and this is it?" (Laughter) "You've achieved nothing,
	commit. Spent the first six months breastfeeding, the way I can see
	it." (Laughter) See, it's outrageous as a conception, but it attracts
	people. The other big issue is conformity. We have built our education
	systems on the model of fast food. This is something Jamie Oliver
	talked about the other day. You know there are two models of quality
	assurance in catering. One is fast food, where everything is standardized.
	The other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants, where everything
	is not standardized, they're customized to local circumstances. And
	we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education. And it's
	impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is
	depleting our physical bodies. (Applause) I think we have to recognize
	a couple of things here. One is that human talent is tremendously
	diverse. People have very different aptitudes. I worked out recently
	that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time Eric Clapton
	got his first guitar. You know, it worked out for Eric, that's all
	I'm saying. (Laughter) In a way, it did not for me. I could not get
	this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it.
	It just wouldn't work. But it's not only about that. It's about passion.
	Often, people are good at things they don't really care for. It's
	about passion, and what excites our spirit and our energy. And if
	you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at,
	time takes a different course entirely. My wife's just finished writing
	a novel, and I think it's a great book, but she disappears for hours
	on end. You know this, if you're doing something you love, an hour
	feels like five minutes. If you're doing something that doesn't resonate
	with your spirit, five minutes feels like an hour. And the reason
	so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn't
	feed their spirit, it doesn't feed their energy or their passion.
	So I think we have to change metaphors. We have to go from what is
	essentially an industrial model of education, a manufacturing model,
	which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people. We
	have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture.
	We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process,
	it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human
	development; all you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions
	under which they will begin to flourish. So when we look at reforming
	education and transforming it, it isn't like cloning a system. There
	are great ones like KIPPs, it's a great system. There are many great
	models. It's about customizing to your circumstances, and personalizing
	education to the people you're actually teaching. And doing that,
	I think is the answer to the future because it's not about scaling
	a new solution; it's about creating a movement in education in which
	people develop their own solutions, but with external support based
	on a personalized curriculum. Now, in this room, there are people
	who represent extraordinary resources in business, in multimedia,
	in the internet. These technologies, combined with the extraordinary
	talents of teachers, provide an opportunity to revolutionize education.
	And I urge you to get involved in it because it's vital, not just
	to ourselves, but to the future of our children. but we have to change
	from the industrial model to an agricultural model, where each school
	can be flourishing tomorrow. That's where children experience life.
	Or at home, if that's where they choose to be educated with their
	families or their friends. There's been a lot of talk about dreams
	over the course of this few days. And I wanted to just very quickly
	-- I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night, recovering
	old poems. I wanted to read you a quick, very short poem from W.B.
	Yeats, who's someone you may know. He wrote this to his love, Maud
	Gonne, and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn't really give
	her what he thought she wanted from him. And he says, "I've got something
	else, but it may not be for you." He says this: "Had I the heavens
	embroidered cloths, Enwrought with gold and silver light, The blue
	and the dim and the dark cloths of night and light and the half-light,
	I would spread the cloths under your feet; But I, being poor, have
	only my dreams; I have spread my dreams under your feet; Tread softly
	because you tread on my dreams." And every day, everywhere, our children
	spread their dreams beneath our feet. And we should tread softly.
	Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much.},

  abstract = {Sir Ken Robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case
	for creating an education system that nurtures (rather than undermines)
	creativity. Why you should listen to him: Why don't we get the best
	out of people? Sir Ken Robinson argues that it's because we've been
	educated to become good workers, rather than creative thinkers. Students
	with restless minds and bodies -- far from being cultivated for their
	energy and curiosity -- are ignored or even stigmatized, with terrible
	consequences. "We are educating people out of their creativity,"
	Robinson says. It's a message with deep resonance. Robinson's TEDTalk
	has been distributed widely around the Web since its release in June
	2006. The most popular words framing blog posts on his talk? "Everyone
	should watch this." A visionary cultural leader, Sir Ken led the
	British government's 1998 advisory committee on creative and cultural
	education, a massive inquiry into the significance of creativity
	in the educational system and the economy, and was knighted in 2003
	for his achievements. His latest book, The Element: How Finding Your
	Passion Changes Everything, a deep look at human creativity and education,
	was published in January 2009. "Ken's vision and expertise is sought
	by public and commercial organizations throughout the world." BBC
	Radio 4 Transcript: --------------- Good morning. How are you? It's
	been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In
	fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes, haven't
	there, running through the conference, which are relevant to what
	I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human
	creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all
	of the people here. Just the variety of it and the range of it. The
	second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's
	going to happen, in terms of the future. No idea how this may play
	out. I have an interest in education -- actually, what I find is
	everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very
	interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in
	education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly,
	if you work in education. (Laughter) You're not asked. And you're
	never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are,
	and you say to somebody, you know, they say, "What do you do?" and
	you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their
	face. They're like, "Oh my God," you know, "Why me? My one night
	out all week." (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they
	pin you to the wall. Because it's one of those things that goes deep
	with people, am I right? Like religion, and money and other things.
	I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have
	a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's
	meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think
	of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065.
	Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that's been on parade
	for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years'
	time. And yet we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability,
	I think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've
	all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that
	children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena
	last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do.
	And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional
	in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary
	dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have
	tremendous talents. And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I
	want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity.
	My contention is that creativity now is as important in education
	as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. (Applause)
	Thank you. That was it, by the way. Thank you very much. (Laughter)
	So, 15 minutes left. Well, I was born ... no. (Laughter) I heard
	a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who
	was in a drawing lesson. She was six and she was at the back, drawing,
	and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention,
	and in this drawing lesson she did. The teacher was fascinated and
	she went over to her and she said, "What are you drawing?" And the
	girl said, "I'm drawing a picture of God." And the teacher said,
	"But nobody knows what God looks like." And the girl said, "They
	will in a minute." (Laughter) When my son was four in England --
	actually he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're
	being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He
	was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? No, it was big.
	It was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel. You may have seen
	it: "Nativity II." But James got the part of Joseph, which we were
	thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We
	had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: "James Robinson
	IS Joseph!" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the
	bit where the three kings come in. They come in bearing gifts, and
	they bring gold, frankincense and myrhh. This really happened. We
	were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence, because
	we talked to the little boy afterward and we said, "You OK with that?"
	And he said, "Yeah, why? Was that wrong?" They just switched, that
	was it. Anyway, the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea
	towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down, and the first
	boy said, "I bring you gold." And the second boy said, "I bring you
	myrhh." And the third boy said, "Frank sent this." (Laughter) What
	these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they
	don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened
	of being wrong. Now, I don't mean to say that being wrong is the
	same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared
	to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original. If you're
	not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults,
	most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of
	being wrong. And we run our companies like this, by the way. We stigmatize
	mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where
	mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that
	we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso
	once said this. He said that all children are born artists. The problem
	is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately,
	that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather,
	we get educated out if it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
	until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los
	Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was.
	(Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just
	outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born.
	Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare
	having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare
	being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of
	it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English
	class, wasn't he? How annoying would that be? (Laughter) "Must try
	harder." Being sent to bed by his dad, you know, to Shakespeare,
	"Go to bed, now," to William Shakespeare, "and put the pencil down.
	And stop speaking like that. It's confusing everybody." (Laughter)
	Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to
	say a word about the transition, actually. My son didn't want to
	come. I've got two kids. He's 21 now; my daughter's 16. He didn't
	want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend
	in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her
	for a month. Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because
	it's a long time when you're 16. Anyway, he was really upset on the
	plane, and he said, "I'll never find another girl like Sarah." And
	we were rather pleased about that, frankly, because she was the main
	reason we were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes
	you when you move to America and when you travel around the world:
	Every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects.
	Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise,
	but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the
	humanities, and the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on Earth. And
	in pretty much every system too, there's a hierarchy within the arts.
	Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than
	drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that
	teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics.
	Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very
	important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're
	allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a
	meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow
	up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And
	then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were
	to visit education, as an alien, and say "What's it for, public education?"
	I think you'd have to conclude -- if you look at the output, who
	really succeeds by this, who does everything that they should, who
	gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd
	have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout
	the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're
	the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there.
	(Laughter) And I like university professors, but you know, we shouldn't
	hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're
	just a form of life, another form of life. But they're rather curious,
	and I say this out of affection for them. There's something curious
	about professors in my experience -- not all of them, but typically
	-- they live in their heads. They live up there, and slightly to
	one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way.
	They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads,
	don't they? (Laughter) It's a way of getting their head to meetings.
	If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way,
	get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics,
	and pop into the discotheque on the final night. (Laughter) And there
	you will see it -- grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off
	the beat, waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper
	about it. Now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic
	ability. And there's a reason. The whole system was invented -- around
	the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before
	the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism.
	So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most
	useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered
	benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you
	liked, on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that.
	Is that right? Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician;
	don't do art, you won't be an artist. Benign advice -- now, profoundly
	mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second
	is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of
	intelligence, because the universities designed the system in their
	image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around
	the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the
	consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people
	think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school
	wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't
	afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,
	more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since
	the beginning of history. More people, and it's the combination of
	all the things we've talked about -- technology and its transformation
	effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population.
	Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I
	was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't
	have a job it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one,
	frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home
	to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the
	previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other.
	It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole
	structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically
	rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence.
	One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that
	we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think
	kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.
	Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions
	of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations,
	intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided
	into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process
	of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes
	about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing
	things. The brain is intentionally -- by the way, there's a shaft
	of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus
	callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday,
	I think this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking. Because
	you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from
	my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is
	not often, thankfully. (Laughter) But you know, she's doing -- no,
	she's good at some things -- but if she's cooking, you know, she's
	dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's
	painting the ceiling, she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If
	I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the
	hook, if she comes in I get annoyed. I say, "Terry, please, I'm trying
	to fry an egg in here. Give me a break." (Laughter) Actually, you
	know that old philosophical thing, if a tree falls in the forest
	and nobody hears it, did it happen? Remember that old chestnut? I
	saw a great t-shirt really recently which said, "If a man speaks
	his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?"
	(Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct.
	I'm doing a new book at the moment called "Epiphany," which is based
	on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their
	talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really
	prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe
	most people have never heard of, she's called Gillian Lynne, have
	you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer and everybody
	knows her work. She did "Cats," and "Phantom of the Opera." She's
	wonderful. I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet, in England,
	as you can see. Anyway, Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said,
	"Gillian, how'd you get to be a dancer?" And she said it was interesting,
	when she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school,
	in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, "We think Gillian has
	a learning disorder." She couldn't concentrate, she was fidgeting.
	I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the
	1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an
	available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have
	that. Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled
	room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat
	on a chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while
	this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was
	having at school. And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing
	people, her homework was always late, and so on, little kid of eight
	-- in the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said,
	"Gillian, I've listened to all these things that your mother's told
	me, and I need to speak to her privately." He said, "Wait here, we'll
	be back, we won't be very long." and they went and left her. But
	as they went out the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting
	on his desk. And when they got out the room, he said to her mother,
	"Just stand and watch her." And the minute they left the room, she
	said, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched
	for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said, "Mrs. Lynne,
	Gillian isn't sick, she's a dancer. Take her to a dance school."
	I said, "What happened?" She said, "She did. I can't tell you how
	wonderful it was. We walked in this room and it was full of people
	like me. People who couldn't sit still. People who had to move to
	think." Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap,
	they did jazz, they did modern, they did contemporary. She was eventually
	auditioned for the Royal Ballet School, she became a soloist, she
	had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated
	from the Royal Ballet School and founded her own company -- the Gillian
	Lynne Dance Company -- met Andrew Lloyd Weber. She's been responsible
	for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history,
	she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multi-millionaire.
	Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm
	down. Now, I think ... (Applause) What I think it comes to is this:
	Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology, and the revolution that
	was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future
	is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start
	to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity.
	Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine
	the earth: for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't
	serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which
	we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas
	Salk, who said, "If all the insects were to disappear from the earth,
	within 50 years all life on Earth would end. If all human beings
	disappeared from the earth, within 50 years all forms of life would
	flourish." And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the
	human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift
	wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios scenarios that we've
	talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative
	capacities for the richness they are, and seeing our children for
	the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being,
	so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future,
	but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it.

  abstract = {Creativity is a very topical issue and indeed a political one. For
	example, the very notion of `little c creativity' seems to be a reflection
	of the requirements of what could be described as a `Post-Fordist'
	economy. However, the call to develop creativity in education is
	largely based on the idea of creativity as the production of novel
	ideas. The central argument of this article is that creativity cannot
	be seen purely in terms of novel ideas but that it is intrinsically
	bound with the teaching of the academic disciplines. It is within
	the context of creativity in the sense of transforming the disciplines
	that two paradoxes are discussed. The first paradox is that the truly
	creative act is not the preserve of the genius but the potential
	for the whole of humanity. Secondly, creativity involves both thinking
	within the constraints of the discipline and challenging those constraints.
	This implies the need for students to engage in meta-discourse, involving
	the nature and history of the subject-matter taught.},
  annote = {`Creativity has been reduced to the production of novel ideas separate
	from the learning of academic subjects. This section argues that
	no separation should be made between promoting creativity and the
	teaching of those subjects.'\cite[p. 47]{rowlands11}
	
	Rowlands (a mathematics educational research) takes a domain-specific
	view of creativity. People need to know a domain and be taught in
	it, to be creative within it. 
	
	Takes an everyday creativity perspective, though he overemphasises
	the prevalence of the genius creativity perspective in current research.
	
	Basically he states the case for novel+appropriate.
	
	`Although this article argues that creativity should not be re- duced
	to the formation of novel ideas, the individual who can formulate
	novel ideas that are appropriate and correct with respect to the
	subject domain can be said to manifest creativity. The ideas formulated
	may only be novel with respect to his or her own understanding of
	the subject; in other words, the ideas may have been thought of before
	by someone else, so the ideas are not truly novel. Nevertheless,
	the construction of a concep- tual understanding of a subject domain,
	as opposed to the memorisation of rule-of-thumb procedures, manifests
	the con- ditions for development towards creativity. '\cite[p. 49]{rowlands11}
	
	He argues against creativity just being novel based on one reference
	that has defined creativity as generating novel outcomes (Diakidoy
	and Kanari 1999) - rather obscure reference to base a major argument
	against?

	IQ tests, the idea being that scores reflect the individual's background
	and information in long-term memory as much as ability per se. The
	investigation reported here attempted to assess the role of experience,
	knowledge, and memory in divergent thinking by comparing 2 kinds
	of tasks. One was a standard divergent thinking task (e.g., "list
	uses for a shoe," "uses for a brick," "uses for a newspaper"). The
	other allowed a number of responses but required that the examinee
	produce factual, knowledge- based responses. A second objective here
	was to compare standard- and knowledge-based ideation with tasks
	that shared 1 domain (e.g., transportation) with tasks that did not
	share a domain. Results indicated that there was a statistically
	significant correlation between the 2 types of tasks but only when
	they shared 1 domain. This was confirmed with product- moment correlations
	(r = .37, p = .025) and a canonical correlation (Rc = .69, p = 008).
	The correlations were not significant when the tasks represented
	different domains. It is interesting to note that both the knowledge-based
	and the standard divergent thinking tasks were unrelated to grade
	point average, which supports their discriminant validity. Limitations
	and directions for future research are suggested. },

	Chickens David O. Seal David O. Seal is an associate professor of
	English at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. The
	Gary Larsen cartoon on page 4 is a favorite of mine; I have had it
	on my office door for years. It says, "God as a kid tries to make
	a chicken in his room." It blows up, of course; feathers fill the
	air, and God's face is smudged with smoke and embarrassment. Creativity
	always exacts a price -- so does writing about it. The word creativity
	itself seems capable of revenge; use it, and you will probably be
	licking feathers. Merely mention the word at a committee meeting
	and watch muscle spasms ripple across the shoulders of the assembled.
	Time-honored tradition says that those who create do not use the
	word, and those who use the word cannot create. Its proscribed status
	identifies it as one of the few words left with some degree of sanctity.
	Like a beautiful wild animal, or a goddess who loves her marginal
	existence, it probably ought to be left alone. Well, maybe not. It's
	too tempting: Somewhere between an itch and a lust is the urge to
	create a few words about creativity. But if that is a good efficient
	cause, the final cause may be even more important: the market out
	there -- whether pedagogical or entrepreneurial -- cannot seem to
	get enough creativity. So I make no apologies for my poultry offering.
	Just don't be surprised when I say that it can still lay. I will
	sketch two different models of creativity, both from psychologists:
	one from a cognitive background and one aligned with depth psychology.
	What they have in common is a preference for mess over management,
	for boundaries transgressed and not respected. They prefer offices,
	and perhaps syllabuses, with a few feathers still floating around.
	Cognitive Approach: Downhill from Age Ten? Howard Gardner (1982),
	a cognitive psychologist from Harvard, is recognized for his interest
	in creativity. Following the developmental program of Jean Piaget
	and supplementing it with his own readings of philosophers of symbolic
	thought, such as Ernst Cassirer, Susanne Langer, and Ernst Gombrich,
	Gardner has been exploring how creativity emerges out of brain processes.
	He has worked in particular with two groups of people: Children and
	brain-damaged adults. He has sought to answer questions that all
	of us have had at one point or another: What happens to the wealth
	of creativity we have as children? Where does it go? What is its
	purpose? And is it art? With children, Gardner maps out how creative
	processes develop alongside the other better-traveled processes of
	growth. "In the period from two to seven, the child comes to know
	and begins to master the various symbols in his culture. Now, in
	addition to knowing the world directly, he can capture and communicate
	his knowledge of things and people through any number of symbolic
	forms, most notably linguistic ones" (1982, 87). The child's facility
	here is astonishing. Gardner mentions a ten year old's powers of
	learning a language, leading us to wonder why we wait until age fourteen
	and over to study a second language. In fact, it is precisely at
	fourteen that something else is happening. After that early childhood
	burst of productivity, a literal stage sets in. Gardner writes, "Let
	a few years pass and everything has changed. The penchant for succumbing
	to convention, for conforming to one's peers, comes to permeate children's
	activities. Even as children at play are determined to follow the
	rules exactly and to tolerate no deviation, so, too, in their use
	of symbols they will brook neither experimentation nor novelty" (1982,
	88). Many of us deplore this stage. We feel that we have lost our
	children to the culture, that the children have lost touch with their
	own free creative spirits, and that our houses and classrooms are
	now inhabited by small lawyers affecting oversized sweatshirts, surfer
	shorts, and high tops. Not so fast, says Gardner. "That concern with
	realism that pervades the literal stage may be a crucial phase of
	development -- the time for mastering rules" (88). And here Gardner
	draws a distinction between the apparent art of a precocious seven
	year old and the ap-parently childish art of a master like Matisse
	or Picasso. Children do not show a sensitivity to "those qualities

  abstract = {Measuring Consciousness: From Behaviour to Neurophysiology How can
	we measure whether a particular sensory, motor, or cognitive event
	is consciously experienced or remains unconscious? Such measurements
	provide the essential data on which a science of consciousness depends,
	yet there is no clear consensus on how such measurements should be
	made. Measures of consciousness cannot exist independently of theory.
	Only by behaving sensibly in a theoretical context do proposed measures
	pick themselves up by the bootstraps, validating both themselves
	as measures of what they say they measure and also validating the
	theories involved. Much of what we know derives from subjective (introspective)
	verbal report, but on some theories such reports confound mechanisms
	of metacognitive access with mechanisms of consciousness and are
	also susceptible to biases. In response, there has been a growing
	emphasis on neurophysiological measures as well as on behavioral
	measures that do not rely on introspection. But for these 'objective'
	measures it can be hard to guarantee that they are measuring consciousness
	per se. I will review definitional, methodological, and conceptual
	issues surrounding the problem of measuring consciousness and describe
	some specific examples based on measures of complexity and causal
	density in neural dynamics. Advances in measuring consciousness have
	implications for basic cognitive science and neuroscience, for comparative
	studies of consciousness, and for clinical applications. References

	by combining several measures of properties of consciousness rather
	than by trying to find one catch-all measure of consciousness * He
	is working by examining tests that measure some property of consciousness
	then intends to combine the results for a more general measure of
	consciousness * The measures of consciousness/properties of consciousness
	are taken from a variety of backgrounds, not just behavioural and
	neurophysiological measures but also originating from complexity
	theory and even economics (Granger causality) * This approach is
	very similar to mine, the main difference that I can see is that
	Anil is working more in a 'bottom-up' way, integrating tests together
	and seeing how the tests match intuition, refining continuously,
	rather than a more top-down approach of determining beforehand a
	set of properties of consciousness then finding suitable tests for
	each property. His is a more immediately hands-on approach (and is
	I think the approach my supervisor favours for my work) although
	I'm not sure how he is avoiding the situation where some vital factor
	of consciousness may be overlooked just because few or no measures
	exist for it at present Measurements of consciousness through behavioural
	measures: * Objective: getting participants to make accurate choices
	under forced decision making conditions * Strategic control: examining
	participants' ability to use or to not use knowledge according to
	instructions (again looking at choices made by participant but now
	under different motivations for the participant) * Subject measures:
	do participants know what they know? (and can they tell us?) * Post-decision
	wagering (participants place bets which reflect their confidence
	in answers given during experiments - Persaud et al 2007, Nature
	Neuroscience) and other recent measures (e.g. Shields, Ruffman) like
	allocating confidence ratings to responses in an experimental situation(Anil
	described work which showed that post-decision wagering was really
	equivalent to confidence ratings) Here different measures fit in
	with different interpretations of or theories about consciousness
	- the measures and the theories/interpretations are interdependent.
	Measurements of consciousness using brain-based measures: * Various
	methods of capturing brain activity, e.g. EEG activity, ERP * While
	subjects are awake, their brain activity indicates more irregular
	activity than when they are asleep (and lower frequency EEG recordings?
	Berger 1929) - indicating that consciousness is only present when
	we are awake? Or present to a greater degree when we are awake? This
	doesn't fit in with the work by Tononi that Anil discussed, which
	treats consciousness as being a capacity for conscious information
	transfer/activity rather than the actual transfer/activity - Tononi
	may probably argue that we are just as conscious when we are asleep
	as when we are awake, its not something that can be switched on or
	off as we wake up or fall asleep. The capacity for us being conscious
	remains the same regardless of our actual acknowledgement of being
	conscious) * Dynamical complexity as a key indicator of the presence
	of consciousness (complex behaviour and information exchange in a
	dynamic system i.e. a system which can change) (Q. So is there a
	threshold value of complexity, so that if a system's complexity is
	above this value than it can be deemed to be (to some degree) conscious?...)
	Measures of dynamical complexity * Neural complexity (all the possible
	combinations of dividing a collection of neurons into 2 subsets,
	and how much information can be retrieved from these subsets) * Information
	integration (the capacity for a system to integrate information dynamically,
	as opposed to the actual activity - Tononi 2004) * Causal density
	(Seth 2005, 2008) Based on Granger causality: the correlation between
	two variables (in one direction: seeing if activity in one variable
	helps predict activity in another variable) Why use different measures
	in parallel? to capture subtly different aspects and to override
	small deficiencies with individual measures (and to avoid overemphasising
	one measure at the expense of others - which measure do you choose
	to trust). Gaillard et al 2009 is a good example of putting together
	multiple measures in parallel, agreeing that there is no single measurement
	for consciousness but several potential measurements. How to decide
	what to measure and what measurements to use? (especially if different
	measures are getting different results). There are some boundaries
	of whether something is conscious to some degree, although these
	aren't so discrete (conscious or not conscious). Intuition helps,
	and if two measures give different results, this is good for refining
	the interaction of measures (although surely good for criticising
	the relevance of the measures as well? Although Anil didn't really
	discuss that). Implementation details will also play a part in choosing
	measures: what is appropriate and reasonable to use in a given scenario.

	Our target users are those who must generate novel ideas and acquire
	relevant information for a certain problem or theme, such as researchers
	or planners. To evaluate and enhance our system, we carried out a
	six-week experiment. During this period, subjects managed their problems

	state of agent = [beliefs, decisions, capabilities, obligations, ***]
	= mental state <described in formal logics>
	
	*** this also includes knowledge. Obligations may have temporal qualities
	associated with them.
	
	Definition of agent as part of AOP: `An agent is an entity whose state
	is viewed as consisting of mental components such as beliefs, capabilities,
	choices and commitments. ... In this view, therefore, agenthood is
	in the mind of a programmer: What makes any hardware or software
	component an agent is precisely the fact that one has chosen to analyze
	and control it in these mental terms.'\cite[p. 52]{wooldridge02}
	
	 In other words, anything that can be ascribed as having mental states
	is potentially an agent, c.f. Dennett's intentional stance - anything
	can be viewed this way - but what gains from being viewed like this?
	
	3 Primary Components of an AOP system (i) Formal specification system
	for mental states (ii) A (universal) communications language (iii)
	``agentifier'' (making agents out of things)
	
	Shoham (1993) covers (i) and (ii), not (iii), and focusses on (ii)
	
	MENTAL STATES barebones: { decisions / choices, beliefs, capabilities,
	obligations } NB decisions = obligations to oneself
	
	Different apps - may need to add to/augment this set. 
	
	Key issues: time, actions (and effects of actions)
	
	MODAL STATEMENTS
	
	[fi] is an action or a fact being TRUE NB [fi] can be recursive
	
	Belief: B^t_a [fi] - agent a believes at time t that [fi] Obligation:
	OBL^t_[a,b] [fi] - agent a is committed to agent b at time t about
	[fi] and Decisions: DEC^t_a [fi] = OBL^t_[a,a] [fi] - agent a is
	committed to itself at time t about[fi] NB Agent a has to believ
	that [fi] is true or achievable Capability*: CAN^t_a [fi] - agent
	a _can_ do [fi] at time t (doesn't necessarily mean it will do it)
	* NB is capability a _mental_ state?ABLE_a [fi] = CAN^time([fi])_a
	[fi] time([fi]) = furthest away time mentioned in [fi]
	
	ASSUMPTIONS - internal consistency of beliefs and obligations [interesting
	- what if there is a clash? e.g. if beliefs are not logically consistent?]
	- An agent will only commit to what it is capable of - An agent is
	aware of its own obligations - persistence of mental states (unless
	proved false) - context-sensitive (appropriate in certain contexts
	- may change in others e.g. be obligated to print a document, as
	long as the network is functioning)
	
	NB Cohen and Levesque's terminology is slightly different: (BEL a
	p) + (G a p) + temporal operations e.g. diamond for sometime (where
	BEL is belief and G is Goal)

	EXECUTE (---> internal actions \& messages out)
	
	Agent's Beliefs, commitments/obligations and abilities/capacities
	also feed into EXECUTE, as well as into the individual 'update' actions

  annote = {Simonton makes two key propositions about creativity: 1. `Creativity
	is a form of leadership in that it entails personal influence over
	others.'\cite[p. 386]{simonton88} 2. `Creativity involves the participation
	of chance processes both in the origination of new ideas and in the
	social acceptance of those ideas by others.'\cite[p. 388]{simonton88}.
	
	
	So Simonton sees creativity as how people's ideas emerge as influential
	when those people are favoured by chance in coming up with new ideas
	and in promoting them to influence others in social/interpersonal
	scenarios. (Creative people would not just be equivalent to lucky
	people, by this interpretation, but chance would intervene in their
	success). He refers to this as the `chance-configuration theory',
	saying that `it outlines the general conditions that favor creativity'\cite[p.
	422]{simonton88}.
	
	Reference to Stein(68)'s four categories for approaches to defining
	creativity: process, product, person, persuasion (interpersonal/social)
	
	Describes how the four Ps should work together but how in practice
	this is not always the case: `Now, in an ideal state of affairs,
	it should not matter which one of the four p's our investigations
	target, for they all will converge on the same underlying phenomenon.
	The creative process should yield creative products, those products
	should emerge from the hands of creative persons with characteristic
	personalities, and those same persons should, through the merits
	of their offered products, convince potential appreciators of their
	creative worth. But reality is not so simple, needless to say. The
	creative process need not arrive at a creative product, nor must
	all creative products ensue from the same process or personality
	type; and others may ignore the process, discredit the product, or
	reject the personality when making attributions about creativity.'\cite[p.
	387]{simonton88}
	
	From this, I would conclude that an accurate and comprehensive definition
	of creativity must account for the (potential) presence of all four
	aspects, in order to be complete. Simonton, however, goes on to conclude
	that `If we cannot assume that all four aspects cohesively hang together,
	then it may be best to select one single definition and subordinate
	the others to that orientation'\cite[p. 387]{simonton88}, with his
	natural research inclination leading him to select \emph{persuasion}.
	
	
	`Creativity cannot be properly understood in isolation from the social
	context, for creativity is a special form of personal influence'\cite[p.
	421]{simonton88}

	We used information theory to derive a simple mathematical expression

	a small sample of participantst, and is illustrated by the responses
	of two typical individuals from an ideational fluency task. The CQ

	(flexibility). Ongoing research will examine the independence of

	that can be explored via simulation.

	ideas.]},

	spread from individuals through society 2. how the value of something
	is determined through social interaction 3. how a culture may evolve

	Presents ``a modeling framework that addresses the worth of ideas
	ascribed by agents embedded in a social world''. [p. 295]
	
	Explore possibilities with computer models:
	
	{\^A}Â· Individualistic models - using algorithms judged to be good
	by humans ``This approach has been a prolific source of models...
	[assuming that] creativity is a type or a combination of generative
	processes carried out by an isolated creator (the computer), and
	that the resulting solutions carry the creativeness to be recognized
	by an external judge (the programmer or the audience''[p. 298] {\^A}Â·
	Interactionist models - add human evaluation explicitly into the
	system, with real-time interaction influencing the development of
	the creative processes. {\^A}Â· Social simulation - worth grows (emerges)
	from several generators and evaluators interacting [but how do you
	judge this worth?]. ''social dimension of creativity'''
	
	Justification of MAS approach [useful references here - Saunders thesis
	2002, Macedo and Cardoso 2001, Sosa and Gero 2005]. Ascribing value
	(and creativity?) is as a result of social interactions - society
	determines what is worthy [(not necessarily what is creative though?
	- later the paper describes an experiment with Design students who
	first come up with ideas individually, then competitively present
	their ideas to each other to see which idea(s) are most recognised
	as valuable - the end result ideas are acknowledged as being less
	original than many of the original individual ideas-novelty as key
	for creativity). This approach is argued to more closely represent
	how human creativity works as it represents better the complex patterns
	of behaviour in human society]
	
	Soft modelling approach (curious and playful exploration) as opposed
	to hard modelling (presumably *** direct one-to-one correlation attempted
	between model and reality)
	
	This paper says a lot about how social interactions play a key part
	in the creative process. _Social_creativity_ shifts the focus from
	a previous emphasis on the creative person (e.g. Guilford, Torrance)
	to take the environmental feedback and interactional influence into
	account.
	
	Multi-agent frameworks (Swarm, netlogo, RePast, Mason) -- criticised
	as not well suited for modelling ideas and dynamic entities. Theories
	of Creative Change (*** LOOK up in paper). 5 theories discussed and
	contrasted (one is Csikszentmihalyi's).
	
	'Equilibrium' and creative change. Static vs dynamic evaluation -
	how does the society change over time?
	
	``This paper challenges the passive view of ideas in current social
	simulation, and proposes a modeling framework where ideas have a
	dynamic role. Rather than considering culture as an idea repository
	... ideas are seen as interacting with each other; they mutually
	affect their meanings and effects; they can be manipulated and at
	the same time they induce the behavior of their adopters; they often
	tend to outlive their creators or adopters.''[p. 296]
	
	IAS framework: Idea / Agent / Society. *** Could I use this? ``a complex
	triad of interactions.''[p. 303] {\^a}â€ ' Idea {\^a}â€ '' Society
	{\^a}â€ '' Agents {\^a}â€ ï¿½ Idea (cyclic)
	
	{\^a}â€ ' Ii {\^a}â€ ï¿½ Is/Si {\^a}â€ ' Ss {\^a}â€ ï¿½ Sa/As {\^a}â€ '
	Aa {\^a}â€ ï¿½ Ai / Ia
	
	Ii, Ss, Aa - intrinsic processes, the other 6 are interaction processes.
	Examples of each are given in paper. Division isn't always clear
	and there appear to be some overlap (authors highlight in particular
	As-agent to group relationship - and Ss - social dimension of this
	relationship), but the authors say the processes are ``illustrative
	rather than prescriptive'' [p. 298].
	
	'What is creativity' becomes 'where is creativity' -- how do people
	recognise creativity? 'Where is creativity' is seen as a more meaningful
	question (cf Csikzentmihalyi's systems view of creativity). [But
	surely the 'what is creativity' question should be at least considered
	if you are researching creativity - face the beast head on!]
	
	Functions are directional: Is: Idea to Society (How society responds
	to an Idea) Si: Society to Idea (How an idea responds to Society)
	
	[To me, the major benefit of the IAS framework is that it forces you
	to think about the social interactions influencing idea production
	and vice versa, in many different perspectives. For example, about
	two pages of this 10 page paper are spent discussing different IAS
	functions in the context of how this function impacts on creativity.
	Potentially a flaw is- can't see how the framework directly accomodates
	the modelling of ideas developing over time - although it provides

  abstract = {Copyright developed in the age of the printing press, and was designed
	to fit with the system of centralized copying imposed by the printing
	press. But the copyright system does not fit well with computer networks,
	and only draconian punishments can enforce it. 
	
	The global corporations that profit from copyright are lobbying for
	draconian punishments, and to increase their copyright powers, while
	supressing public access to technology. But if we seriously hope
	to serve the only legitimate purpose of copyright - to promote progress,
	for the benefit of the public - then we must make changes in the
	other direction. This talk will also cover the unjust goals of the
	Digitial Economy Act and what the UK ought to do instead. 
	
	Richard Stallman launched the development of the GNU operating system
	(see www.gnu.org) in 1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the
	freedom to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes
	either large or small. the GNU/Linux system, basically the GNU operating
	system with Linux added, is used on tens of millions of computers
	today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper Award, a MacArthur
	Foundation fellowship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer
	Award, and the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well
	as several honorary doctorates.},
  annote = {8th March 2011
	
	copyright is presented almost as censorship. Stallman wants to reduce
	copyright durations to a maximum of 10 years or remove restrictions
	entirely, depending on whether the work in question is a work of
	art (10 years), a testimonial work (allow redistribution but not
	amending) or instructive work (freely allow redistribution).
	
	Does Stallman view a professional programmer in the same light as
	a drugs baron???
	
	One quote during questions:
	
	``reward the creative person, not the business'' e.g. the musician
	not the record label. Can't a business or group of people be creative??
	What about GNU or FSF, are these groups creative? Or should we reward
	the programmers and not the FSF group?

	(b) impression that methods aren't well-based in psychology (c) study

	discipline-blinkered focus on what creativity actually is (this is
	linked to problems of definition of creativity (d) ) Sections in
	this paper on each of these Mysticism of creativity - `associations
	to mystical beliefs' (p. 4), divine inspiration, etc (e.g. Plato's
	reference to the Muse as inspiration and Rudyard Kipling's `Daemon
	in the Pen' and other references) `Many people seem to believe ...

	:) `Some psychologists ... avoided this measurement quagmire in favor
	of less problematic research topics' \cite[p. 7]{sternberg99a} Criticisms
	of divergent-thinking psychometric tests: - Looking at trivial and
	inadequate instances of creativity (e.g. filling in Circles with
	drawings) rather than more meaningful examples of creativity (discussed
	further in Sternberg 86) - Based on {fluency, flexibility, originality,

	further in Amabile 83) - Does everyday creativity indicate genius
	potential? p. 7 `the definition and criteria for creativity are a

  annote = {\citeA{tardif88} refers to Stein's approach to viewing creativity
	as process, persons, products and places\cite{stein68}. \citeauthor{tardif88}
	discuss each view individually, `as these really are separate levels
	of analysis, and it is from comparisons within levels that coherent
	statements about our knowledge of creativity can be made'\cite[p.
	429]{tardif88}. 
	
	This summary does not make comparisons across levels, despite using
	Simonton's outlining of Stein's framework - which stresses that these
	four views or levels interact and relate to each other \cite{simonton88}.
	
	
	Q. What does Stein say?
	
	Mooney \cite{mooney63} says that the four approaches should be integrated,
	if modelling the concept of creativity.
	
	
	PROCESS
	
	Creativity - social or individual process? 
	
	Creativity is not just the first flash of inspiration, but also contains
	the activity that happens to validate, develop, and refine that first
	idea, cf. the 'validation' stage in \citeA{wallas26}.
	
	Following on from this are comments about time periods in creativity
	- not just one point in time, but also devepment time.
	
	Creativity is domain-specific? Csikszentmihalyi, Johnson-Laird and
	others argue that it is, however `there are some claims for universals
	in creativity ... Thus, several general charactistics of creative
	thinking, regardless of domain, have been proposed [in the papers
	collated in \citeA{sternberg88}]'\cite[p. 431]{tardif88}: - transformation
	of representations - redefining problems - applying familiar patterns
	to new situations - nonverbal modes of thinking - tension during
	the creative processs, such as conflict between constraint and new
	idea, various contradictory ideas existing at once and the need to
	organise chaos - different degrees of creative expression exist
	
	PERSONS
	
	Three categories identified to describe creative people: - cognitive
	attributes - personality attributes and motivation - developmental
	influences [three different modes of study-cognitive, psychology/psychometric
	and developmental?]
	
	Even within this volume, there is disagreement on which cognitive
	characteristics should be attributed to creative people: Table 17.1
	\cite[p. 434]{tardif88} shoows that different authors highlight a
	variety of different characteristics, with no general consensus and
	no characteristics mentioned by each author.
	
	PRODUCTS
	
	A shorter section, which concludes that `what we sorely need are some
	solid data on the differences between products in various domains
	and the qualities they must display in order to be deemed creative'\cite[p.
	438]{tardif88}.
	
	PLACES (DOMAINS, FIELDS, CONTEXTS)
	
	Both 1. creative domains and 2. the social environments in which creative
	people are influenced as they employ creative process, advertise
	their creative products and receive feedback from.},

	The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that language has an impact on how
	we view the world. Different languages mean that people have different
	parameters for perspectives: your native language sets up a number
	of constraints as to how you experience and view things (by what
	words you know to express the experience). 
	
	NB if differences exist, we are able to figure them out over time,
	or to have them explained, but they are not immediately obvious or
	necessary for us (though we may appreciate others' need for them)
	
	e.g. - Eskimo has several words for `snow' (because of a much increased
	practical need for differentiation) - Hopi (an American Indian language)
	has three different words for `that' (depending on context) - Sami
	(Lapp - Scandinavian) has several words for reindeer - Bedouin Arabic

	her prose is operatic, with voices singing varied parts, each distinct
	yet all harmonious, combining the memories of previous sounds to
	propel the latest discovery. She attempts to communicate not just
	thought, but rather the dynamic life of the logos. The second aspect
	of this paper deals with what Frank Wilczek has called ``opportunities

	Testing the combination of Ritchie's 18 criteria and Colton's tripod
	to evaluate a system - in particular aimed at testing the sufficiency
	(as opposed to necessity) of this "combined framework" (p. 11) Trying
	to break it! But in a productive way... to see exactly what this
	combination does provide and where further work is needed to improve
	the framework's robustness. [DV concedes that neither Ritchie or
	Colton claim their proposals provide a necessary and sufficient framework
	to evaluate creativity] Sufficiency: is the combinatory framework
	\emph{all} you would need for evaluation? During the thought experiment,
	a key decision is made that perhaps undermines the entire paper contents:
	``In our \emph{gedanken} experiment, since we are interested simply
	in (artefact) class membership (how recognizable an image is), the
	two rating schemes of the 3-tuple become redundant (that is, \textbf{typicality
	and quality are equivalent for this task}[this emphasis added]),
	and we can think of the 2-tuple definition as capturing this by compressing
	both into the single rating scheme \emph{r}.''\cite[p. 12]{ventura08}
	So instead of having two ratings (one for typicality of an artefact
	in a given style, one for the quality of an artefact), these are
	combined into one rating \emph{r}. But... as typicality and value
	are not distinct, is \citeauthor{ventura08} now \emph{not assessing
	for creativity}, but instead only assessing for value/quality? As
	he treats the typicality and value of the artefacts produced by RASTER/iRASTER
	as the same thing, he has found that several of the criteria can
	be reduced to more simple forms and there are now many duplicates
	in the set of criteria (only 3 distinct criteria remain for RASTER,
	which has no inspiring set, and 7 distinct criteria remain for iRASTER,
	which has an inspiring set). Ventura suggests a ``meta-heuristical
	application'' of Ritchie's criteria as a result: ``if most of the
	criteria \emph{can not} be applied, then the system in question may
	not be a likely andidate for attribution of creativity''. The trouble
	with this conclusion is that there is nothing in Ritchie's papers
	prohibiting us from using only 3 criteria to assess systems; this
	application of the criteria is perfectly allowable in Ritchie's proposals.
	There is a slightly different conclusion that I would draw: as Ventura
	is rating artefacts of RASTER/iRASTER for recognisability rather
	than typicality and value, he is arguably no longer assessing RASTER/iRASTER
	for creativity, so the criteria are therefore no longer relevant.
	This is close to the conclusion that Ventura reaches after seeing
	that most criteria reduce to duplicates of each other, once the typicality
	rating scheme is made equal to the value rating scheme). A weakness
	of the presentation of Ritchie's criteria is that Ritchie repeatedly
	says that the criteria are not intended as a definitive set but instead
	as a set of possible tools for analysis from which the researcher
	can pick; no criteria are advocated as essential and no recommendation
	is made for including all or any criteria, or for how to weight each
	criterion's contribution to the overall assessment of creativity
	(e.g. iRASTER scores 0 for criterion 9, but this criteria could be
	weighted substantially less than the other criteria so that it has
	almost no effect on the end assessment). So the non-committal way
	in which Ritchie presents the criteria gives no protection against
	attacks such as that made by Ventura. comment in footnote of p. 12
	that Ritchie (surprisingly perhaps?) does not formalise the definition
	of the inspiring set but just describes it in relatively vague language.
	There has been some discussion as to how the inspiring set should
	be interpreted \cite{colton01,odonoghue07,ventura08} as well as in
	the review commentary on my own paper \cite{jordanous10b} and some
	confusion. In such a carefully formulated paper it is surprising
	that this important definition (the inspiring set I appears in all
	criteria from 9 onwards) is left undefined formally, and is not updated
	even in the revised 2007 version of the criteria. In the thought
	experiment, RASTER produces direct replications or near copies of
	photos on the web, in black and white. It generates random binary
	images, compares them to a random picture on the web (using Hamming
	distance per pixel) and returns any patterns with a small enough
	difference (given some threshold $\theta_f$). Ventura argues that
	RASTER does not have an inspiring set (i.e. |I| = 0). His justification
	that the entire space of web images is not an inspiring set is because
	the web images do not guide the RASTER algorithm. DV doesn't make
	this argument formally as he has no formal definition of the inspiring
	set to work with. I would say that the web images have a direct impact
	on the results of the creative process so they do have influence
	on the program output, and as the program is constructed to make
	use of these images it can be argued that the web images ``[influence]
	(either explicitly or implicitly) the construction of the program''.
	iRASTER is essentially RASTER but with a set of photos as an inspiring
	set used to generate raster patterns (through genetic operators)
	instead of random binary images. (It is not stated where this set
	of photos comes from - is it from the collection of all web photos?)
	Considering the creative tripod, Ventura uses one short paragraph
	to justify each system's creativity, as opposed to the two pages
	per system needed for Ritchie's criteria! 2 objections noted by DV
	for thought experiment: - majority of Ritchie's criteria are redundant
	- the time needed for RASTER to produce anything is likely to be
	huge. First objection is discussed above. Second objection: perhaps
	there should be a new criterion or extension to Colton's tripod measuring
	how efficient the system is, for example how long does the system
	take to produce artefacts (with some acceptable limits specified),
	or how many artefacts does the system produce compared to how many
	it generates (i.e. output to discarded items ratio). Do we impose
	such demands on creative people? Perhaps not at first, or posthumously
	- however during their lifetime people who are creative for their
	livelihood have deadlines for producing work and an associated necessity
	to produce e.g. to get money to live etc. Having said that, we would
	not consider it a problem for creative people to generate and then
	discard a large amount of their items, if they produced and made
	available a sufficient number of end-products to satisfy their audience/critics.
	Ventura isn't really combining the two frameworks, but is applying
	both frameworks separately to the same systems to see if they both
	generate positive assessments of creativity. Could the two frameworks
	be combined better and would this lead to different results? Most
	of the paper is devoted to looking at Ritchie's criteria (approx
	5 pages) as opposed to the combination of Ritchie and Colton's work
	(approx 1 page in total), or Colton's work on its own (less than
	1 page in total). (The rest of the 9-page paper gives details of
	the thought experiment systems, reference details, etc.) One point
	Ventura does make about Colton's tripod is that it would not appropriate
	to formalise the three qualities that form the tripod because Colton
	doesn't advocate that the presence of these three qualities is necessary
	for creativity but that the system should be \emph{perceived} to
	have these three qualities. From this, Ventura goes on to question
	the informativeness of any rating system that involves subjective
	judgements by humans. This is a dangerous conclusion to head towards
	as it essentially disregards qualitative evaluation as a useful scientific
	process? ``[On asking if Ritchie's criteria can be argued for in
	the same way that Colton suggests his tripod qualities should be
	detected] This in turn leads us to ask whether any rating scheme
	that is subjective (human evaluated) is not \emph{ipso facto} subject
	to a No-Free-Lunch type argument that demonstrates that it will be
	uninformative on average.'' \cite[p. 18]{ventura08} Some final points
	from DV in the conclusion - typ and val ratings may change over time
	- people's perception of typ and val can be influenced by others
	and by their changing knowledge. - consequently is self-promotion
	a key attribute needed in a creative system? [to what are creative
	people successful self-promoters? NB this last question is probably
	a whole other research project!] PRODUCT vs PROCESS: If you implemented
	RASTER/iRASTER and gave its products to people to evaluate, without
	telling them anything of the process, they would probably rate the
	system creativity highly. As the system process is designed to be
	decidedly non-creative, however, if the evaluators were informed
	of how the programs work, then this would probably have a negative
	impact on how creative the systems were judged to be. So although
	some conclusions of the thought experiment are questionable, Ventura
	has contributed towards the debate about whether process is important
	when assessing the creativity of creative systems. },

	with validity, open-ended questions that elicit students' constructed
	responses are beneficial. But the high cost required in manually
	grading constructed responses could become an obstacle in applying
	open-ended questions. In this study, automated grading schemes have
	been developed and evaluated in the context of secondary Earth science
	education. Empirical evaluations revealed that the automated grading
	schemes may reliably identify domain concepts embedded in students'
	natural language responses with satisfactory inter-coder agreement
	against human coding in two sub-tasks of the test (Cohen's Kappa
	= .65--.72). And when a single holistic score was computed for each
	student, machine-generated scores achieved high inter-rater reliability
	against human grading (Pearson's r = .92). The reliable performance
	in automatic concept identification and numeric grading demonstrates
	the potential of using automated grading to support the use of open-ended
	questions in science assessments and enable new technologies for

  abstract = {It has been suggested that individuals with synaesthesia may show
	heightened creativity as a result of being able to form meaningful
	associations between disparate stimuli (e.g. colour, sound). IN this
	study, a large sample N = 82 of people with various kinds of synaesthesia
	were given two psychometric tests of creativity (Remote Associates
	Test, Alternate Uses Test) and were also asked about the amount of
	time engaged in creative arts (visual art, music). There was a significant
	tendency for synaesthetes to spend more time engaged in creative
	arts and this was, at least in part, dependent upon the type of synaesthesia
	experienced. For example, synaesthetes experiencing vision from music
	were far more likely to play an instrument than their other synaesthetic
	counterparts. There was no relationship between this tendency and
	the psychometric measures of creativity, but synaesthetes did outperform
	controls on one of the two psychometric measures (Remote Associates).
	We conclude that the tendency for synaesthetes to be more engaged
	in art is likely to have a different mechanism to psychometric measures
	of creativity, and that there is no direct link between them. Although
	synaesthetes may well perform better on some measures of creativity,
	we suggest that synaesthetes have better bottom-up access to certain
	associations, but are not necessarily better able to use them flexibly
	(in divergent thinking).},

  annote = {Warner argues that mechanical processes such as that employed by
	(all) computational processes are demonstrative of an absence of
	creativity, because of the description in \citeA{feist91} of processes
	that are `so mechanical or routine as to require no creativity whatsoever.'\cite[p.
	362]{feist91}
	
	Warner comes to this conclusion by arguing that computation involves
	`mechanical procedures', and that the use of the phrase `so mechanical'
	in \citeA{feist91} is equivalent to the use of the word `mechanical'.
	His argument is based on the argument that `so mechanical', in a
	continous sense, correlates directly to `mechanical', in a discrete
	sense (so in actual fact this `careful and exhaustive process of
	correlation' \cite[p. 10]{warner10} contains logical flaws):
	
	\begin{quote} `\emph{So} in ``so mechanical or routine'' ... directly
	qualifies mechanical and indicates that it is to be understood in
	its most intense sense. \emph{Mechanical} in a ``mechanical procedure''
	is understood in an absolute sense, as matter of preliminary scientific
	definition. ... A similarity in intensity of meaning then has been
	established.' \cite[p. 5]{warner10} \end{quote}
	
	It is my opinion that Warner interprets this phrasing in \cite{feist91}
	with more significance than was originally intended, and over-correlates
	`mechanical' with `computational', in coming to this conclusion.
	Nonetheless \citeA{warner10} is an expression of the often tacit
	belief that computers cannot be creative, using Supreme Court decisions
	as evidence to back up this conclusion:
	
	\begin{quote} `The extreme absence of, or antithesis to, creativity
	has been precisely identified, primarily through a careful and exhaustive
	process of correlation. A precise correlation, of ``so mechanical''
	... with an automatic mechanical procedure, has been established,
	which strengthens and refines the gestalt effect of analogy between
	the not original and computability.' \cite[p. 13]{warner10} \end{quote}},

  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the measurement and application of lexical
	distributional similarity. Two words are said to be distributionally
	similar if they appear in similar contexts. This loose definition,
	however, has led to many measures being proposed or adopted from
	fields such as ge- ometry, statistics, Information Retrieval (IR)
	and Information Theory. Our aim is to investigate the properties
	which make a good measure of lexical distributional similarity. We
	start by intro- ducing the concept of lexical distributional similarity.
	We discuss potential applications, which can be roughly divided into
	distributional or language modelling applications and semantic ap-
	plications, and methods of evaluation (Chapter 2). We look at existing
	measures of distributional similarity and carry out an empirical
	comparison of fifteen of these measures, paying particular attention
	to the effects of word frequency (Chapter 3). We propose a new general
	framework for distributional similarity based on the concept of lexical
	substitutability, which we measure using the IR concepts of precision
	and recall. This framework allows us to investigate the key factors
	in similarity of asymmetry, the relative influence of different contexts
	and the extent to which words share a context (Chapter 4). Finally,
	we consider the application of distributional similarity in language
	modelling (Chapter 5) and as a predictor of semantic similarity using
	human judgements of similarity and a spelling correction task (Chapter
	6).},

	for cases when certain contexts aren't represented in the model.
	(create a number of different order markov chains, check highest

	match is found.) Part of this work is to explore back-off sequences
	to find the most productive back-off paths to follow here. 3 sub-tasks
	of 4-part harmonisation (from previous literature): - harmonic skeleton
	(assigning harmonic symbols to each beat - chord skeleton (filling
	in actual notes for each chord) - ornamentation (adding extra notes
	like passing notes) [nb isn't it better to think of passing notes
	when filling in notes, to enable passing notes in appropriate places?]
	Plus looking at cadence points first. Focus on chord skeleton subtask?
	This isn't so clear at first. 2 passes to assign notes, trying to
	use minimum music-theoretic information and instead learn as much
	from corpus as possible. Markov models constructed using maximum
	likelihood estimation (prob of a given harmonic symbol in a particular
	context) --- Evaluation Study --- Used cross-entropy to evaluate
	models against ground truth of a test set. (Lowest cross-entropy
	for a test sequence == best model of the data) [Could do with a layman's
	introduction to cross-entropy - even just a sentence or two? seeing
	as it is the key to the evaluation. from wikipedia, that source of
	accurate knowledge: the cross entropy between two probability distributions
	measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event from
	a set of possibilities] Tested two different model types (either
	using root position harmonic symbols or with inversion information).
	Parameters varied = corpus size (its effects on test data [3 hymns]
	and on generated harmony). 10-fold cross validation also performed
	to check correctness. [Evaluation of harmonies in this section: "harmonies
	are often quite good" (p. 84) "[harmonies] sound further removed
	from the style of the corpus... displeasing to the ear" (p. 84) i.e.
	highly subjective, no formal evaluation here of quality or creativity]

	of Back-off Strategies --- To improve back-off strategies for locating
	contexts in the model. Systematic exploration of possible search
	paths but not rigourous or exhaustive - expected to be close to optimal
	(but is work in progress). Currently authors have only explored up
	to second order models (3-gram Markov chains, i.e. sequences of 3
	harmonic symbols). So far, have found that higher order models are
	(unsurprisingly) more optimal in terms of lower cross-entropy but
	no real discussion of the complications involved in investigating
	higher order models (time, working memory demands etc). Some optimal

	between goals? Are they mutually exclusive? (prob not but they aren't
	seen as the same thing) * Is this partly a reaction to a backlash
	against the concept of computers being creative?
	
	Fine distinction between understanding/replicating such creative behaviour
	and in implementing systems that can behave creatively in this way
	and \textit{develop} this behaviour.
	
	Straight away in this paper, on the first page (p. 35) we are invited
	to evaluate the quality of the YQX system. Videos at http://www.cp.jku.at/projects/yqx
	(this link only contains videos, no other explanations or links to
	papers directly from here)
	
	Although the introduction leads straight into talk about the clean
	sweep of awards won by YQX at Rencon 2008 (an expressive performance
	contest at ICMPC 08), the authors are quick to point out that `winning
	Rencon awards is not the main goal of this research' \cite[p. 35]{widmerAIM09}
	... the main goal actually is to explore how `AI methods can help
	us learn more about a creative human behavior'\cite[p. 36]{widmerAIM09}.
	
	Q. Does YQX replicate human creativity (very well) or does it discover/create
	new and creative ways of playing Chopin's and Mozart's music?
	
	A1. How did the judges at Rencon evaluate performances? (Not explicitly
	stated in paper) Judges: 1. participants (experts) 2. A panel (for
	technical merit of the system) 3. The composer of the two pieces
	(in style of Chopin and Mozart respectively) - which system affected
	him emotionally the most in how they interpreted his pieces (one
	would assume this emotional affect would need to be positive for
	this evaluation...!)
	
	Paper refers to Glenn Gould's recordings of Mozart piano sonatas.
	GG's deviances from traditional interpretative style are not attributed
	as mistakes by GG but instead as unconventional stylistic choices.
	This liberty is not afforded to the YQX system. 
	
	`Of course, YQX's performance of the complete piece is far from musically
	satisfying. Listening to the entire performance, we hear passages
	that make good musical sense and may even sound natural or ``human-like'',
	but we also observe quite a number of blatant mistakes or unmusical
	behavior, things that no human pianist would ever think of doing.'
	\cite[p. 43]{widmerAIM09} [... really?? not even someone like Glenn
	Gould? Or someone in x decades time, when expressive performance
	has evolved to a different set of standards...?]
	
	So there is nothing like, e.g. Colton's HR system finding a mathematical
	conjecture that was unexpected/unknown to the programmer and p-creative,
	but for which value could be recognised by the programmer/observer
	(expert).
	
	Also human error is acknowledged in preparing the input score (some
	passages of the pieces are transposed wrongly).
	
	Autonomy of YQX/ system making choices that aren't programmed in/expected:
	`With YQX, we have no idea why the system chose to do what it did'
	(beyond finding similar examples in the training corpus) Does this
	transcendance from programmers' instructions give YQX a greater claim
	for being creative? Because no explicit rules are being followed?
	
	Discussion of creativity of the system helps lead on to identify various
	areas where the system can be improved (though is the end goal still
	quality/human replication or has it started to be creativity? e.g.
	tracing individual style: no comment on developing new individual
	styles, just on characterising/capturing individual styles (though
	to this aim, there is comprehensive work being done by the authors).
	
	Last sentence of the paper is a nice summary of the authors' intentions:
	`We will continue to test our models in scientific contests such
	as Rencon, and leave it to the audiences to decide whether they consider
	the results creative.'\cite[p. 47]{widmerAIM09}},

  abstract = {Closing the Loop: Computational Creativity from a Model of Music Cognition
	This talk is about computational modelling of a process of musical
	composition, based on a cognitive model of human behaviour. The idea
	is to try to study not only the requirements for a computer system
	which is capable of musical composition, but also to relate it to
	human behaviour during the same process, so that it may, perhaps,
	work in the same way as a human composer, but also so that it may,
	more likely, help us understand how human composers work. We take
	a purist approach to our modelling: we are aiming, ultimately, at
	a computer system which we can claim to be creative. Therefore, we
	must address in advance the criticism that usually arises in these
	circumstances: "a computer can't be creative because it can only
	do what it has explicitly been programmed to do". This argument does
	not hold, because, with the advent of machine learning, it is no
	longer true that a computer is limited to what its programmer explicitly
	tells it, especially in a relatively unsupervised learning task like
	composition (as compared with the usually-supervised task of learning,
	say, the piano). Thus, a creative system based on machine learning
	can, in principle, be given credit for creative output, much as Wolfgang
	Amadeus Mozart is deemed the creator of The Magic Flute, and not
	Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang's father, teacher and de facto agent. Because
	music is a very complex phenomenon, we focus on a relatively simple
	aspect, which is relatively easy to isolate from the many other aspects
	of music: tonal melody. In order to compose music, one normally needs
	to learn about it by hearing it, so we begin with a perceptual model,
	which has proven capable of simulating relevant aspects of human
	listening behaviour better than any other in the literature. We also
	consider the application of this model to a different task, musical
	phrase segmentation, because doing so adds weight to its status as
	a good, if preliminary, model of human cognition. We then consider
	using this model to generate tonal melodies, and show how one might
	go about evaluating the resulting model of composition scientifically.
	We place the discussion in the context of current models of creative
	cognition.},

  annote = {The paper describes an attempt to encode creative systems in a mathematically
	rigorous way (using set theory). The paper's title is: Categorising
	Creative Systems. So for a start, the title is clear, concise and
	understandable. It is obvious that he is looking to make some effort
	to formalise the description of creative systems. The three-sentence
	abstract again is easy to read - Wiggins introduces what he is about
	to discuss in the paper, what the aim of his work is, and a longer
	term view of the role of this work. Ideally I would have liked to
	see a little more detail of the exact work being presented in the
	paper, but this is only a small consideration for me - my prime concern
	is that I can understand the full abstract and have an interest in
	reading the whole paper, which this abstract achieves. One thing
	I noticed instantly about this paper was the use of entertaining
	subtitles. In essence, the work that Wiggins presents is quite dry:
	using set theory to categorising creative systems. However subtitles
	such as Hopeless Uninspiration and Productive Aberration are quite
	interesting to see and definitely capture my interest! Alongside
	the more traditional titles such as Background and discussion, there
	is a good balance of standard academic presentation and an interesting
	style of writing. In general the structure of this paper is very
	neat, with small sections, and an easy pathway through the surface
	of the content is given by just reading the titles and subtitles
	- I like that a lot as a way of getting a general overview. Wiggins
	also tells us in the introduction what each section is going to discuss
	(and each section does then indeed discuss that content!). The conclusion
	and summary paragraph, although brief, sums up well what the paper
	has told us and points the reader in the direction of future work,
	justifying the progression from this 2003 point to the future work
	suggested. Looking back into the content of the paper, the language
	is understandable and just at the right technical level: not patronising
	but also not overcomplicated. It is easily accessible to those who
	have not read the previous work that has been cited, or to those
	who are a little rusty on set theory (me!) or creativity theory.
	In particular, the example that Wiggins uses to illustrate the abstract
	theory is very well presented. I possibly would question how he fits
	this example to Margaret Boden's original theory (which is the theory
	he is using as a basis of his theoretical framework); however this
	indicates that I do have a good understanding of the general more
	abstract notions that he is discussing, and can engage with this
	discussion as a result, to refine my understanding of smaller details
	and perhaps notice areas of the theoretical discussion that I would
	be able to improve on or highlight as needing further work. Finally
	the 6 references that Wiggins gives are useful for directing the
	reader to further work that is relevant. He doesn't include any 'tenuous'
	references; instead you can see exactly where in the paper each reference
	makes an important contribution to the content. At the same time
	he has some important references there such as Margaret Boden's seminal
	work on creativity (The Creative Mind, 1990). So in conclusion: the
	paper is well-structured, concise and expressed at a very good level
	of technical description. What could have been quite complicated
	set-theoretical discussion is made accessible to readers such as
	myself, who have some background in this area and want to learn about
	the resulting framework rather than spend time understanding lots
	of theory. This review is carried out after a few skim reads of this
	paper. I think I will follow up the leads next and make sure that
	I completely understand the theoretical framework he proposes, but
	I have a suspicion that this framework (now 5 years old) may have
	considerably been updated. This paper definitely leaves me wanting
	to find out more! },

	system that is capable of \emph{independent} action on behalf of
	its user or owner. In other words an agent can figure out for itself
	what it needs to do in order to satisfy its design objectives.' \cite[p.
	3]{wooldridge02}
	
	[My design objectives = produce creative behaviour?]
	
	Definition of a multiagent system: `A multiagent system is one that
	consists of a number of agents, which \emph{interact} with one another,
	typically by exchanging messages through some computer network infrastructure.
	... In order to successfully interact, these agents will thus require
	the ability to \emph{cooperate, coordinate} and \emph{negotiate}
	with each other, in much the same way that we cooperate, coordinate
	and negotiate with other people in our everyday lives.'\cite[p. 3]{wooldridge02}
	
	Wooldridge identifies two main problems that are key in MAS research
	(p. 3) - How to build such autonomous agents (agent design: micro)
	- How to enable agent interaction - particularly when goals may conflict
	(society design: macro) 
	
	[In my case, producer agents want to be the most creative and most
	recognised, and critic agents want to be most influential and accurate
	critics.]

	of social processes'\cite[p. 8]{wooldridge02} e.g. EDS project, Doran
	and Palmer (1995) Palaeolithic culture
	
	`It is notoriously hard to precisely model the behaviour of human
	societies, simply because they are dependent on so many parameters
	... Multiagent systems provide a powerful and novel tool for modelling
	and understanding societies' \cite[p. 11]{wooldridge02} (although
	\citeauthor{wooldridge02} goes on to stress that directly modelling
	human behaviour isn't necessarily the best approach for MAS design).

	CHAPTER 2: Intelligent Agents --- This chapter provides a new definition
	of agent, using more technical and specific language (adapted from
	Wooldridge and Jennings (1995) Intelligent agents: theory and practice
	[Knowledge Eng. Rev 10(2)]): `An agent is a computer system that
	is \emph{situated} in some \emph{environment}, and that is capable
	of \emph{autonomous action} in this environment in order to meet
	its design objectives'\cite[p. 15]{wooldridge02}
	
	So: Intelligent Agents - key features AUTONOMY GOAL-DRIVEN SITUATED
	Also (from p. 23) reactivity pro-activeness (linked to goal-driven)
	social ability (linked to Situated)
	
	Agents (usually) have _actions_ available - to modify environment/influence
	changes in environment - may fail - no guarantees in a non-deterministic
	environment - come with pre-conditions - making decisions about which
	action to do
	
	Different types of environment: Inaccessible --- vs --- accessible
	[information to agents] static --- vs --- dynamic[information gathering
	necessary at each time t_n] discrete --- vs --- continuous[fixed
	finite no of actions and percepts?] deterministic --- vs --- non-deterministic
	[consequences of actions fixed?]
	
	Trade-off between simplicity and realism in design: open environment
	= inaccessible, dynamic, continuous, non-deterministic
	
	episodic environment (Russell and Subramanian 1995)(p. 22) Agents'
	behaviour linked to discrete, independent episodes (no link between
	different episodes in past/future - just concentrating on the current
	episode in isolation)[is this what I want? or do I want them to learn
	from the past and adapt?]
	
	Interactions: in real time? This decision is influenced by the objectives
	of the MAS: - perform some action by some time point? OR - achieve
	goal as quickly as possible? - repeat action as often as possible?
	remembering that decision time also plays a part in communication
	time.
	
	Balance between reactive and goal-driven agents: if not reactive:
	can't adapt to changing circumstances if not goal-driven: may never
	focus on end goal to achieve it, but would be distracted away by
	reactions elsewhere
	
	interaction - negotiation, co-operation, also compromise
	
	`Objects do it for free; Agents do it because they want to.'\cite[p.
	26]{wooldridge02}
	
	`active objects' as `autonomous concurrent entities'
	
	References \citeA{mccarthy79} and Shoham (1990) Agent-oriented programming,
	for further comment on how agents act as autonomous concurrent entities.
	Also Dennett 1996 (Kinds of Minds) and 1987 (The Intentional Stance).
	
	
	Agents have perceptions of the environment (percept = perceptual input
	to agent i.e. state of environment _as_agent_sees_it_ - they may
	not need to see all info, or some info may be inaccessible. [possible
	mismatch between internal states of the agent vs environmental states]
	
	Agent tasks - how to tell agents what to do (their goal) can specify
	goal directly, or indirectly (using a performance measure)
	
	Utility function (local view)u: E -> |R real value ( |R )for every
	environment state (score of how good it is for that agent) (score
	= 'utility')
	
	(or long term view) u: R-> |R assign utility to runs through environment
	rather than individual states (run = R)
	
	
	Optimal Agents - maximise expected utility (similar to in decision
	theory - see Russell and Norvig 1995 p. 472)
	
	[Wooldridge includes some complex looking stuff (pp. 40-42) on specifying
	tasks formally. Didn't take notes on this but can come back to it
	later if worth it]

	The two most important performatives are INFORM and REQUEST
	
	
	Chapter 9: Working together ---
	
	- Handling inconsistencies NB no agent is likely to have a full picture
	of the whole scenario/environment
	
	- co-ordination (managing interdependencies)
	
	Positive and Negative relationships between agents Positive: mutually
	beneficial, helping, assisting or beneficial to the receiver Negative:
	competitive, unhelpful or selfish
	
	Decision: can either allow properties and strategies to emerge, or
	can design such properties and strategies offline before system runs
	
	
	Chapter 10: Methodologies for development of agent systems ---
	
	This chapter content is as of 2001/2002... probably lots of development
	since then
	
	4 factors outlined in pp. 225-226 as to *when agent-based solution
	is appropriate*: - `The environment is open' (or `highly dynamic,
	uncertain, or complex', if not open) - `Agents are a natural metaphor'
	e.g. modelling societies co-operating or competing - `Distribution
	of data, control or expertise' - `Legacy system' (updating previous
	agent systems)
	
	[The first three of these are relevant for me - needs to be open/complex
	and uncertain for creativity to be possible - modelling creative
	society context - expertise is divided between different Producers
	and also between different Critics ]
	
	Generally, methodologies for implementation of MAS are:
	
	ABSTRACT MODEL -> SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED MODEL -> ... -> CONCRETE,
	DETAILED MODEL
	
	 - - - - - - refinements over time -- - - - - - - -- - - - >
	
	Methodology development: inspired by O-O development + methodologiesvs
	using knowledge engineering/other techniques
	
	OO development: AAII (Kinny et al 1996), Gaia (Wooldridge et al 1999),
	adopting UML (Odell et al 2001, Depice et al 2001, Bauer et al 2001)
	
	Knowledge engineering/other techniques: DESIRE (Brazier et al 1999),
	Z (Luck et al 1997, d'Inverno \& Luck 2002), Cassopeia (Collins et
	al 1996)
	
	[Are any of these examples useful to me? more details here...]
	
	* AAII:- PRS-based (Purely Reactive Systems?)using BDI architecture
	(see Wooldridge (2001) Reasoning about Rational Agents - MIT cognet?)
	internal model: BDI of agents external models: viewing agent system
	structure- agents are the main components - define relationships
	(inheritance) between agents- show what instances of agents are used
	at run-time
	
	 External Model | v Agent Model / Interaction model [related through
	inheritance, aggregation and instantiation] || vv Agent class model
	Agent instance model BDI attributes
	
	Internal model | v (looking at paper) beliefs, goals, plans [details
	are hazy in Kinny et al 1996] [prob close to implementation of PRS
	agent - how different is that to a BDI agent? is this due to planning,
	goals, etc?]
	
	Wooldridge summarises methodology (p. 228) as: 1. Identify ROLES in
	domain and use these to develop AGENT CLASS HIERARCHY 2. For each
	role, identify:- responsibilities associated- services required by
	role ] what are the GOALS associated- services provided by role ]
	with each service? 3. For each goal, identify - plans that could
	be used- appropriate context for each plan 4. Identify belief structure
	of system - what info is needed for each plan/goal
	
	eg: weather monitoring system 1. ROLES: agent_i makes agent_j aware
	of weather each hour 2. GOALS for agent_i: find out current weathernotify
	agent_j of current weather 3. PLANS for agent_i:goal: find out current
	weatherplan = look up from MET officegoal: notify agent_j of current
	weatherplan = send a message to agent_j 4. INFO NEEDED: (system)
	representation of temperature, windspeed, wind direction etc
	
	[ My system in AAII:
	
	Roles: Producer, Critic
	
	Responsibilities of Producer Role (services): produce creative music
	communicate with critics over workpublicise work to criticsanswer
	critic's questions about work update confidence levels based on critic
	response Responsibilities of Critic Role (services): Judge music
	produced by producersPerform testsDetermine if more information is
	needed for testsAsk questions (if necessary)Send the producers their
	feedback ]
	
	* Gaia (Wooldridge et al) - abstract and concrete concepts
	
	Abstract concepts: [used to represent system in concept, but not directly
	implemented] - roles - permissions - responsibilities- liveness properties-
	safeness properties - protocols - activities
	
	Concrete concepts: [directly implemented at run time] - agent types
	- services - acquaintances
	
	`building agent-based system' = `process of _organizational_design_'
	\cite[p. 229]{wooldridge02}
	
	Analysis (to understand system/structure before implementation) ORGANISATION
	- collection of ROLES [roles are related to other roles and can interact
	with each other]
	
	ROLES: key responsibilities (functionalities of role)permissions (rights
	that this role has)activitiies (autonomous functions - what it can
	do with no interactions needed) protocols (how it can interact with
	other roles)
	
	liveness (ensure something good happens) vs safeness (ensure nothing
	bad happens)
	
	* Cassopeia (Colins et al 1996 - agent-oriented design of a soccer
	robot team at ICMAS 96, then Robocup 2001 http://www.robocup.org)
	\cite[p. 231]{wooldridge02} - identify ELEMENTARY BEHAVIOURS needed
	for systems task - identify RELATIONSHIP between elementary behaviours
	- identify ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOURS of systems (how agents group,
	interact etc)},

  abstract = {Theoretical proposals suggest that emotional intelligence (EI) may
	favor creativity. In the present paper, two studies are reported
	with French adults to examine the degree to which the ability to
	identify emo- tion is related to creative performance. This component
	of ability EI was hypothesized to be positively associated with a
	divergent thinking task involving emotional information. Contrary
	to our expectations, the first study (n = 95) indicated that ability
	to identify emotions in faces and images was negatively related to
	idea generation ability. The second study (n = 100) including a measure
	of alexithymia con- firmed this relation. Moreover, evaluating emotional
	creativity, we observed a significant negative link between the ability
	to identify emotions and the tendency to experience emotions differently
	from those of others. We discuss these results suggesting an opposition
	between consensual/convergent thinking concerning emotions (ability
	EI) and divergent thinking.},

	- both during his lifetime and post-humously. One wonders if the
	popularity of his work was the driving force behind getting his work
	exhibited, for example the New York exhibition was arranged by executives
	from Columbia record label \cite{jet85}. citeA{davis09} touches on
	the monetary value of his paintings, and whether it is just his fame
	as a musician that gives the paintings their value: `Although he
	kept referring to painting as his ``hobby,'' the works exhibited
	in Munich were priced from $750. There was obviously still a good
	deal of ambivalence about his new activity: ``Quincy Jones called
	me up and said 'Man, I want to buy one of your paintings.' I told
	him to call [his personal manager] Peter. But, hell, I'd give one
	to him. I'm always giving sketches away. If I had to make money from
	this, I'd starve. It's only my name. People say `Let's see what Miles
	is thinking about.' '' He looked down at the canvases on the floor
	and murmured, as though to himself: ``Just doing this, could I make
	a living? Maybe so.'' Then the doubter turned into the confident
	pop star again: ``Fortunately, I have something to fall back on.
	I make enough royalties so that I'll be 95 before I spend all the
	money and wear all my clothes.'' ' \cite[p. 319]{davis09} },

  annote = {this particular workshop is an independent event rather than a conference
	symposium, running over three days. It comes from a merging of two
	workshop series, from Creative Systems Workshops and the AISB Symposia
	on AI and Creativity. Paper acceptance rate 27 submissions were made
	to the workshop, reviewed by at least 3 peer reviewers, and this
	resulted in 17 papers being presented and 3 posters accepted in addition
	- an acceptance rate of 20/27. Quite high but in this pioneering
	field a lot of work is being done in early stages and the field has
	not reached a maturity or depth of research yet which would merit
	a harsher rejection rate. People involved and community coverage
	The list of reviewers is a comprehensive list of prominent workers
	in Computational Creativity. Significantly (to me at least), Margaret
	Boden is not part of the Programme Committee, despite her important
	contribution to creativity theory and her near location to London.
	However I understand from recent conversations with researchers here
	that she is moving away from being involved in creativity and has
	always held more of a cognitive or philosophical outlook on creativity
	rather than a computational interest, (despite certain passages in
	her publishing suggesting the beginnings of a computational framework
	for creativity). There are a few other people missing who it would
	have been great to involve, but factors such as location, the lack
	of perceived prestige and the high specificity of the workshop theme
	may well explain this. Eduardo Miranda, Alice Eldredge, Philip Johnson-Laird,
	Robert Sternberg, David Cope and Doug Hofstadter spring to mind here
	(although some of these people are very high-profile academically
	and their involvement in a conference would instantly bring the conference
	much wider international kudos!). However, the presence of people
	such as Geraint Wiggins and Am\'ilcar Cardoso (co-organisers), Pablo
	G\'ervas, Graeme Ritchie and Gerhard Widmer on the program committee
	means that there are some significant researchers here from this
	field. In addition, there are submissions from people such as Elaine
	Chew, Jon McCormack, William Latham, Ana Paiva and Chris Thornton
	(my supervisor), who are all people I have come across in one way
	or another during my two terms at Sussex. Papers are contributed
	from across Europe, from Australia and also from North and Central
	American universities - so a wide coverage. (Its interesting that
	even though my voice separation project earlier this term doesn't
	immediately spring to mind as an obvious link to computational creativity
	research, there are a number of people at this conference who have
	carried out similar work on voice separation: Gerhard Widmer, Elaine
	Chew and Ana Paiva. Makes me think that maybe I can justify the inclusion
	of this work into a thesis on computational creativity in music...
	but those thoughts are definitely for a later date!) Themes at the
	workshop: I'll start with the two themes of most interest to me:
	Musical Creativity and Frameworks for Creativity. Then I'll work
	through the other themes in order of interest. Musical Creativity
	This is very interesting to me; as such little work has been done
	from an academic perspective on computational musical creativity,
	I am eager to find discussions about it. The papers presented here
	on musical creativity take diverse approaches, from Artificial life
	to statistical models. This is great as there are so many possible
	options here, and the field of research is very young and ripe for
	exploring. However there are only four papers presented at this session,
	I would have liked to see more depth (obviously!) The music that
	is created in practical systems ranges from chord-based accompaniment
	for existing songs, to randomly generated musical melodies. It is
	interesting to see the accompaniment generation work, in particular,
	as this involves more musical factors than single instrument melodies
	due to the possibilities in the interactions between each note being
	played at a single time. But this work looks to be quite musicologically
	based, in other words it is a result of following analytical rules,
	rather than looking more at inspirational artistic creativity. I
	guess I want to see more on generation of completely novel music,
	without following pre-determined, strict 'rules of thumb'. I might
	be a little bit ambitious here in what I am looking for though, given
	the current state of research here. A related paper of interest here
	is a discussion of evaluation and systematic improvement methods
	in models of harmony - definitely worth more than the skim read I
	have so far given it as evaluation will form a major part of my PhD
	thesis. Frameworks for Creativity As I have a very strong interest
	in Creativity theory, I am approaching my work from the viewpoint
	of realising theory in practice, rather than retrospectively engineering
	creative practice to fit a theoretical framework. So discussions
	at this session of the workshop are very relevant to me (* although
	I mustn't neglect research into practical creativity just because
	it isn't my specialist area...!) My supervisor, Chris Thornton, presents
	an interesting view on Margaret Boden's creativity theory as a quantifiably
	realisable framework rather than a qualitative discussion of differences
	in creative practice. I have learnt a bit about the work he is doing
	in this area but it is useful to read papers like this where he puts
	his thoughts down to paper. Some interesting references here to look
	up as well. As this is such a fledgling area of research, the papers
	here don't go into much depth but instead present brief discussive
	overviews of computational creativity theory - as I would expect
	to see. Again there are useful considerations of problem areas and
	evaluation techniques, so I think that I'll get a lot from analysing
	the contents of this session in more depth. Applied Creative Systems
	Like I have said earlier, I really should show more interest in this
	than I currently do. The actual implementation of creativity theory
	will hopefully for me result in a creative system or systems of my
	own, so I need to get a more deep view of the creative systems currently
	being made, rather than the broad but shallow view I currently have.
	There is some very interesting discussion here of creative systems
	demonstrating humour (which I have heard of) and one that comes up
	with advertising slogans (which I wasn't aware of). The creativity
	theory in the literature has been incorporated into the discussions
	to some extent, but I would like to really read these papers and
	see if I can work out exactly how much of the theory has actually
	been incorporated in the design of these systems. From previous exposure
	to creative systems, I suspect that only a subsection, if any, of
	the theory has actually been directly implemented in the systems.
	I'll see at a later date if my suspicions are well-founded? Analogy
	and Language, and Creativity in Narrative To be honest again, I really
	don't know much about this area. I am trying to be quite selective
	about the reading I do here, as it is a little off-topic. However
	they do propose some interesting modelling attempts here, which is
	relevant to me as I want to create computational models of creativity.
	Also I am starting work into models of creativity in language, with
	the perspective of replicating this work in musical creativity (I'm
	quite fascinated by the various links between music and language,
	especially at a neurological level - also linguistic creativity is
	much more studied than musical creativity, from a computational viewpoint).
	Pablo G\'ervas is one of the people I have come across so far in
	work on linguistic creativity, so I will take a look at the paper
	he has submitted here, and check out the others as part of the reading
	for this project, but otherwise I may spend my reading time elsewhere.
	Are there any important themes that haven't been discussed at this
	workshop? I have to say, I can't think of any in particular, although
	I am not yet very up to date with current research into computational
	creativity. I would have liked to see more discussion of the links
	between theory and practice in creativity, as this is my concentration,
	but I'm aware that little work has been done here. I'm sure it would
	have come up in discussions to some degree as both Geraint Wiggins
	and Pablo G\'ervas have done work I am aware of in this area, but
	then without having been to the workshop I wouldn't know (next year
	though...!) So all in all, there is some useful content here, even
	though some people don't appear to be involved in the workshop whom
	I would like to have seen mentioned. As my supervisor, Chris Thornton,
	was involved in the workshop, we have spoken since about this workshop.
	He described it as interesting but not a major signpost in academic
	advancement! Which seems fair enough - I think I agree.},

  address = {Conneticut, US},
  annote = {review by Maggie Boden: There are very few books on computer creativity,
	so for that reason alone this collection of new papers would be welcome.
	But there are two additional reasons for welcoming it. First, the
	ten chapters, each of which is interesting, include four gems: of
	which three come from Douglas Hofstadter's stable. Hofstadter himself
	has contributed an updated version of his typically-insightful and
	provocative piece on the latest version of David Cope's music composer
	called Emmy: Staring Emmy Straight in the Eye and Doing My Best Not
	to Flinch. In terms of the `fool-factor,' i.e. the ability to fool
	even experts into thinking that they're encountering something created
	by a human being (and a very special one, at that: Mozart, Stravinsky,
	Joplin...), Emmy wins hands down over other composing programs. (Cope
	is a professional composer himself, and it would be interesting to
	know just how much that helped.) There's plenty of food for thought
	here, as Hofstadter has to do some pretty subtle, some might say
	Jesuitical, arguing to avoid being seduced by Emmy's charms. This
	trio is completed by two papers on the long-announced `Letter Spirit'
	project. One (by Gary McGraw and Hofstadter) describes the mature
	philosophy/plan behind Letter Spirit, while the other (by John Rehling)
	describes some early results. It's no accident that we've had to
	wait so long: Letter Spirit is ambitious, even for Hofstadter, and
	this is a significant achievement. The core problem is how to represent
	different letter-fonts. How can a cognitive system interpret Prinz
	and Lawrence Barsalou on everyday creativity. No Mozarts here. Or
	rather, they show that in a real sense we're all mini-Mozarts, for
	we all enjoy creative capacities as part of our general intelligence,
	even including perceptual pattern- recognition and the production---and
	interpretation---of graphic symbols. The second reason for welcoming
	the volume is that it offers us added value in the form of `interactions'
	on every chapter. Terry Dartnall, the editor, provides most of these.
	He engages with the authors in a thought-provoking to-and- fro that's
	sure to make one think, whether or not one agrees with him. Overall,
	this collection explores the nature of creativity. Those computer
	models that are mentioned are situated in that general philosophical
	context. It's not a book for nerds! Margaret A. Boden Research Professor

	position to creativity: ``\emph{Creativity} refers to a product,
	and if made by a man, we give him the honor of the adjective'' \cite[p.
	viii]{kagan67} He cites the Jackson and Messick paper in the volume
	to back this up (how they describe the creative product), perhaps
	ignoring the fact that they also emphasise the person and the response
	to the product. Q. Do Jackson and Messick emphasise a 3-fold view
	of creativity or a product-centred view? Movement at the time of
	writing (1960s) from assigning creativity after creative production,
	to predicting creativity. ``There is a tendency to confuse capacity
	for creativity with the creative man, where we would never confuse
	fertility with number of children.''\cite[p. viii]{kagan67}. i.e.
	Kagan strongly advocates that you need \emph{proof} of creativity
	in order to be considered creative. (i.e. judged on creative products).
	Q. Do I want to argue against this, and if so, how? By empirical
	study results? (judge creativity of these products - but is this
	a leading question?) Kagan does acknowledge the influence of personal
	characteristics and motivating and environmental influences on creative
	production (as contributory to creative product but not actually
	part of creativity). Particularly Kagan stresses that most of the
	authors mention the negative effect of errors, or of being criticised,
	on producing creative artefacts [remember this is in a learning context].
	``A creative product is actively sculpted, not passively generated.''\cite[p.
